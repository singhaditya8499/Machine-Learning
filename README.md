# Machine Learning

This is a repository of my learning about machine learning and other different topics associated to the broad field of AI.

## Datasets

1. [Fashion-MNIST](datasets/Fashion-MNIST)
2. [AutoMPG](datasets/Auto_MPG)
3. [Housing Prices](datasets/Housing-Prices)

## Knowledge

1. Optimizers in Neural Network [Link](concepts/Optimizer.md)
2. Backpropagation [Link](concepts/Backpropagation/README.md)
3. Broadcasting Semantics [Link](concepts/Broadcasting_semantics.md)

## Awesome papers

1. **Capsule Network:** CapsNet is a type of neural network that uses bunch of neurons to represent the internal structure of an image. It overcomes the shortcomings of the CNN. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.09829.pdf)
2. **Byte level encoding:** Encoding is very important when it comes to LLMs. This GPT-2 paper introduces the concept of the byte level encoding algorithm. [Paper](https://insightcivic.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/language-models.pdf)
3. **Transformers:** [Paper](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)
4. **Backpropagation:** Learning representation by backpropagating errors [Paper](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/naturebp.pdf)
5. **Batch normalization:** Batch normalization is a method used to make training of artificial neural networks faster and more stable. It is a technique used to normalize the inputs of each layer in such a way that they have a mean output activation of zero and a standard deviation of one. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03167.pdf)

## Projects

1. **Covid 19 tweets classification:** Text classification tasks related to tweets about the Coronavirus. The data has been gathered from Twitter, and manual tagging has been performed on the tweets. To protect privacy, the names and usernames have been replaced with codes. [Link](Projects/Coronavirus_tweet_prediction)
2. **Natural disaster tweets classification:** Prediction of which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not. [Link](Projects/Disaster_tweet_prediction)
