### Optimizer Comparison:

1. **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**
   - Classic optimizer.
   - Simple and widely used.
   - May take longer to converge compared to more sophisticated optimizers.

2. **RMSprop:**
   - Adaptive learning rate method.
   - Addresses some issues with SGD.
   - Suitable for non-stationary objectives.

3. **Adagrad:**
   - Adaptive learning rate for each parameter.
   - Can have difficulty with sparse data.

4. **Adadelta:**
   - Extension of Adagrad.
   - Dynamically adapts learning rates.
   - Addresses Adagrad's diminishing learning rates issue.

5. **Adam:**
   - Combines ideas from RMSprop and momentum.
   - Adaptive learning rates and momentum.
   - Generally performs well across various tasks.

6. **Adamax:**
   - Variant of Adam.
   - More robust to heavy-tailed gradients.

7. **Nadam:**
   - Nesterov-accelerated version of Adam.
   - Incorporates Nesterov momentum.

8. **FTRL (Follow The Regularized Leader):**
   - Online learning method.
   - Suitable for large-scale linear models.

9. **Proximal Adagrad:**
   - Extension of Adagrad with L1 regularization.
   - Suitable for sparse models.

10. **Proximal Gradient Descent:**
    - Extension of SGD with L1 regularization.

### Choosing an Optimizer:
- **Adam:** Generally a safe default choice. Works well across different scenarios.
- **RMSprop:** Suitable for non-stationary objectives, such as in recurrent neural networks.
- **SGD:** Simple and often effective, especially for smaller datasets.
- **Adadelta:** Useful for its adaptive learning rates.
- **Choose based on task:** The best optimizer may vary depending on the specific task and dataset. It's recommended to experiment with a few options to find the one that works best for your use case.

### Experimentation:
- When comparing optimizers, conduct experiments by training the same model with different optimizers and monitoring metrics like training loss and validation accuracy.
- Consider adjusting learning rates and other hyperparameters for each optimizer to ensure fair comparisons.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all solution, and the optimal optimizer may vary for different tasks and datasets.
