Song Name: Tim McGraw
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin God that you werent here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
Its hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin back on all of that its nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And Im back for the first time since then
Im standin on your street
And theres a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that youll read is

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday youll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said Thats a lie

Song Name: Picture To Burn
State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine Ill tell mine that youre gay
By the way

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned
Youre just another picture to burn

Theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned
Youre just another picture to burn

And if youre missing me
Youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health

Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak
Whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned
Youre just another picture to burn

Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby burn

Song Name: Teardrops On My Guitar
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
That I want and Im needing
Everything that we should be

Ill bet shes beautiful that girl he talks about
And shes got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
That I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me

He says hes so in love hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows hes all I think about at night

Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing Dont know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

Shed better hold him tight give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know shes lucky cause

Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing Dont know why I do

So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
Ill put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing Dont know why I do

Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see


-----
Song Name: A Place In This World
I dont know what I want so dont ask me
Cause Im still trying to figure it out
Dont know whats down this road Im just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though Im not the only one
Who feels the way I do

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on my old blue jeans
And Im wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrows just a mystery oh yeah
But thats OK

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe Im just a girl on a mission
But Im ready to fly

Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Ill be strong Ill be wrong oh but life goes on
Oh Im alone on my own and thats all I know
Oh Im just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Oh Im just a girl
Oh Im just a girl oh oh
Oh Im just a girl

Song Name: Cold As You
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take you take the very best of me
So I start a fight cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want cause Im not what you wanted

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away aint no use defending words that you will never say
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing honey but I cried cried for you
And I know you wouldnt have told nobody if I died died for you died for you

Oh what a shame what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that Im sitting here thinking it through
Ive never been anywhere cold as you


-----
Song Name: The Outside
I didnt know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason
I know I didnt read between the lines
And baby Ive got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This aint the best view
On the outside looking in
And Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

You saw me there but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this a part of you
And now its all too late So you see

You couldve helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until its too late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This aint the best view
On the outside looking in
And Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside

Oh yeah

So how can I ever try to be better
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you
This aint the best view
On the outside looking in
And Ive been a lot of lonely places
Ive never been on the outside


-----
Song Name: Tied Together With A Smile
Seems the only one who doesnt see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking youre not pretty
But thats not true cause I know you

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone

I guess its true that love was all you wanted
Cause youre giving it away like its extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

Oh cause its not his price to pay
Its not his price to pay

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone

Hold on baby youre losing it
The waters high youre jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry but you dont tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone

Youre tied together with a smile
But youre coming undone
Goodbye baby
With a smile baby baby

Song Name: Stay Beautiful
Corys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
Theres pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as hes walking home
Saying Does he know
Will you ever know

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation
When hes taking my breath away
I should say hey by the way

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold
At least youll know

Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Will you stay
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
La la la
Oh oh oh oh
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na na na na na

Song Name: Should've Said No
Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that youd take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes

You shouldve said No you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with herd
Get back to me get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said No baby and you might still have me

You can see that Ive been crying
And baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same

You say that the past is the past you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes

You shouldve said No you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with herd
Get back to me get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said No baby and you might still have me

I cant resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this

No no no no

You shouldve said No you shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word
Bout what you did with herd
Get back to me get back to me
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said No baby and you might still have me

Song Name: Mary's Song (Oh My My My)
She said I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said Oh my my my

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said youd beat me up you were bigger than me
You never did you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids you and I
Oh my my my my

Well I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasnt that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed wed really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said Oh my my my

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two AM riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside til the morning light
Oh my my my my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
Well rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time you and I

Ill be eightyseven youll be eightynine
Ill still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky oh my my my

Song Name: Our Song
I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
Hes got a onehand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around turn the radio down
He says Baby is something wrong
I say Nothing
I was just thinking
How we dont have a song
And he says

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway
Well on my way
To my lovin bed
I almost didnt notice
All the roses
And the note that said

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on your window
When were on the phone and you talk real slow
Cause its late and your mama dont know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date Man I didnt kiss her and I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again

Ive heard every album listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin out late tapping on his window
When were on the phone and he talks real slow
Cause its late and his mama dont know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date Man I didnt kiss him and I should have
And when I got home  fore I said Amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh yeah
Ohoh yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song

Song Name: I'm Only Me When I'm With You
Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin pictures in the sky
And sometimes we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you

Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me

Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you

When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me
Who I wanna be
Well Im only me when Im with you
With you

Song Name: Invisible
She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
Shell never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you cant see me wantin you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Theres a fire inside of you
That cant help but shine through
Shes never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Shes never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh were invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She dont even know you
Baby let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She cant see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile

Song Name: A Perfectly Good Heart
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Maybe I shouldve seen the signs shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still cant believe
That you would walk away
It dont make sense to me but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart

Song Name: Last Christmas
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby do you recognize me
Well its been a year it doesnt surprise me

Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool Ive been
But if you kissed me now I know youd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
Im hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year Ill give it to someone special

Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It wont be anything like anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
Ill give it to someone special

Song Name: Christmases When You Were Mine
Please take down the mistletoe
Cause I dont wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My mommas in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope youre well
Well Im doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

Ive been doing fine without you really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybodys here except you baby
Seems like everyones got someone to hold

But for me its just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas everybody
Thatll have to be something I just say this year
Ill bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands

I know this shouldnt be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didnt wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine

Song Name: Santa Baby
Santa baby slip a sable under the tree for me
Ive been an awful good girl Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby a 54 convertible too light blue
Well Ill wait up for you dear Santa baby

Think of all the boys I havent kissed

If you check off my Christmas list

Santa baby I want a yacht and really thats not a lot
Ive been an angel all year Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey theres one more thing I really do need
The deed
To a platinum mine Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffanys

Lets see if you believe in me

A ring
And I dont mean on the phone Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Silent night holy night
All is calm and all is bright
Round yon virgin mother and child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace

Silent night holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glories stream from Heaven afar
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ our Saviour is born

Silent night holy night
Son of God
Loves pure light
Radiant beams from thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Hallelujah

Song Name: Christmas Must Be Something More
What if ribbons and bows didnt mean a thing
Would the song still survive without five golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie
Tell me what would you find

Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away
Tell me what would you find

Youd see that today holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to the birthday boy who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundredmileanhour lives
And its this time of year
And everybodys here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy not superficial
So heres to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
Its something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But heres something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

Theres gotta be more
Theres gotta be more

Song Name: White Christmas
Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

Im dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Im dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Song Name: Jump Then Fall
I like the way you sound in the morning
Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk you didnt notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together
Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
Ive never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted

I had time to think it all over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me
Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you Ill catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Dont be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Imma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall baby
Jump then fall into me into me

Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine
And every time youre here
Baby Ill show you Ill show you
You can jump then fall jump then fall
Jump then fall into me into me yeah

Song Name: Untouchable
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you
Im caught up in you

Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway

But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on

Oh in the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

Im caught up in you Oh oh

But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on oh oh

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on come on

In the middle of the night
Waking from this dream
I wanna feel you by my side
Standing next to me
You gotta come on come on
Say that well be together
Come on come on
Little taste of Heaven

In the middle of the night
When Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
You gotta come on come on
Come on come on
Come on come on oh oh oh

Like a million little stars
Spelling out your name
Theyre spelling out your name oh

Song Name: Forever & Always (Piano Version)
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When he said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
I dont think so oh oh oh
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Back up baby back up
Please back up oh back up
Back up baby back up

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

And I stare at the phone
He still hasnt called
And then you feel so low
You cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to
When we said forever and always
Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here
And it rains when youre gone
I was there when you said forever and always

You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah

Song Name: Come In With The Rain
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I Ive got you down
I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start

Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Oh just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

Ive watched you so long
Screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say

But Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hopin
That youll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Song Name: Superstar
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There aint nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Morning loneliness comes around when Im not
Dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face Id be
Counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and
All the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
And Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another
Wide eyed girl whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar
Sweet sweet superstar superstar

Song Name: The Other Side Of The Door
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up

Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone
Going through the photographs staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door and all the things that I misread

So babe if you know everything tell me why you couldnt see
That when I left I wanted you to chase after me

Yeah I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say Theres nothing you can say to make this right again
I mean it I mean it
What I mean is

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im in love with you
Wait there in the pouring rain come back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess I need you


-----
Song Name: Fearless
Theres somethin bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot
Yeah
Oh yeah

Were drivin down the road
I wonder if you know
Im tryin so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin me want you

And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

So baby drive slow
Til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake
Im not usually this way
But you pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss
Its flawless
Really something
Its fearless

Oh yeah

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first
Fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance in a storm in my best dress
Fearless

Ohoh
Oh yeah

Song Name: Fifteen
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the morning of your very first day
You say Hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Feeling like theres nothing to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be out of here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feeling like flying
And your mammas waiting up and youre thinking hes the one
And youre dancing round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
When youre fifteen
And your first kiss makes your head spin round
But in your life youll do things greater than dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen
Dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Song Name: Love Story
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting All theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story Baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while
Oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting All theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story Baby just say Yes

Romeo save me Theyre tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid Well make it out of this mess
Its a love story Baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

Marry me Juliet Youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad Go pick out a white dress
Its a love story Baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh oh oh oh

Cause we were both young when I first saw you

Song Name: Hey Stephen
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm yeah

Hey Stephen
I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked
We were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to

Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen
Boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Hey Stephen
Ive been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you ha
Ive seen it all
So I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen
Why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Theyre dimming the street lights
Youre perfect for me Why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine

Hey Stephen
I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls
Well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you
Haha

I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain
So come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Myself
Cant help myself
I cant help myself

Song Name: White Horse
Say youre sorry
That face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holding on
The days drag on
Stupid girl
I should have known I should have known

That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

Maybe I was naïve
Got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams
About you and me
Happy endings
Now I know

That Im not a princess this aint a fairy tale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet
Lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse to come around

And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness begging for me
Just like I always wanted but Im so sorry

Cause Im not your princess this aint a fairy tale
Im gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse to catch me now

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now
Oh its too late
To catch me now


-----
Song Name: You Belong With Me
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend
Shes upset shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do

Im in the room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts
I wear Tshirts
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your wornout jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy

And youve got a smile
That could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while
Since she brought you down

You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey what you doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels
I wear sneakers
Shes cheer captain
And Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see
That Im the one
Who understands you
Been here all along
So why cant you see
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me

Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Song Name: Breathe
Taylor Swift
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time

Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me ohoh

I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Im sorry Im sorry Mmm
Im sorry Yeah yeah Im sorry
Im sorry Im sorry
Im sorry

Song Name: Tell Me Why
I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof but Im not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why

You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say oh

Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why Why
Tell me why Why

I take a step back let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know

Song Name: You're Not Sorry
All this time I was wasting
Hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long
Baby but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again
But not this time around

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no no no

You are looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life
If you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no no

Youre not sorry no no no

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright
But I watched all of it fade

So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby
Like I did before
Youre not sorry no no no

Youre not sorry no no no
No no no no
No no no no
No no no no

Song Name: The Way I Loved You
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing
And Im comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you oh oh

And thats the way I loved you oh oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you


-----
Song Name: Forever & Always
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so

Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always

And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said forever and always yeah

Song Name: The Best Day
Im five years old its getting cold Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother inside and out
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

Song Name: Change
And its a sad picture
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again
And you know its all the same
Another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it

But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh

So weve been outnumbered
Raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now
Find things they never found
They might be bigger
But were faster and never scared

You can walk away say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh

Tonight we stand get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

Song Name: Mine
You were in college working parttime waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say Can you believe it
As were lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Flash forward and were taking on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

And I remember that fight
Twothirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the Goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on make it last
Hold on never turn back

Hold on
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
Hold on
You are the best thing thats ever been mine

Hold on
Yeah yeah
Do you believe it
Hold on
Were gonna make it now
Hold on
And I can see it
Yes yes
I can see it now see it now see it now

Song Name: Sparks Fly
The way you move is like a fullon rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see
What I was thinking of

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me
Youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really something
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Ill run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Wont you whisper soft and slow
Im captivated by you baby like a firework show

Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh baby smile
And the sparks fly

Song Name: Back To December
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while

Youve been good busier than ever
We smalltalk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call

And I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came the dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was Goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right

Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December

It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Id go back to December turn around and make it all right
Id go back to December turn around and change my own mind

I go back to December all the time
All the time

Song Name: Speak Now
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a whiteveil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Dont say Yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me
Dont you

Dont say Yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
Dont say Yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said Speak now

Oh la la
Oh oh
Say a single vow

I hear the preacher say Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence theres my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only looking at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in on a whiteveil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

So dont say Yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
And you say Lets run away now
Ill meet you when Im out of my tux at the back door
Baby I didnt say my vows
So glad you were around
When they said Speak now

Song Name: Dear John
Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor wont fall through
Again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
And go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules every day

Wonderin which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well I stopped pickin up and this song is to let you know why

Dear John
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home
I shouldve known

Well maybe its me
And my blind optimism
To blame
Or maybe its you and your sick need
To give love then take it away

And youll add my name
To your long list of traitors
Who dont understand
And I look back in regret
How I ignored when they said
Run as fast as you can

Dear John
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

Dear John
I see it all now It was wrong
Dont you think nineteens too young to be played
By your dark twisted games
When I loved you so
I shouldve known

You are an expert at Sorry
And keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that youve run dry
Have tired lifeless eyes
Cause youve burned them out

But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So dont look now
Im shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town

Dear John
I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Cried the whole way home

I see it all now that youre gone
Dont you think I was too young to be messed
With
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song
You shouldve known

You shouldve known
Dont you think I was too young
You shouldve known

Song Name: Mean
You with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like Im nothing
You with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when Im wounded
You picking on the weaker man

Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you dont know what you dont know

Someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

You with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I dont already see them
I walk with my head down trying to block you out
Cause Ill never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you cant lead me down that road
And you dont know what you dont know

Someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobodys listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I cant sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar and pathetic and alone in life
And mean and mean and mean and mean

But someday Ill be living in a big old city
And all youre ever gonna be is mean yeah

Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday Ill be living in a big old city
Why you gotta be so mean
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean
Someday Ill be big enough so you cant hit me
Why you gotta be so mean
And all youre ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean

Song Name: The Story Of Us
I used to think one day wed tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say Theyre the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now Im searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I dont even know what page youre on

Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I cant break through

Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

Howd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And youre doing your best to avoid me
Im starting to think one day Ill tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you shouldve held me

Oh Im scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing
Id tell you I miss you but I dont know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud

Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armour down
If you said youd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now Im standing alone in a crowded room and were not speaking
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
But I dont know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now now now

and were not speaking
And Im dying to know is it killing you like its killing me yeah
I dont know what to say since the twist of fate cause were going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end

Song Name: Never Grow Up
Your little hands wrapped around my finger
And its so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
So I tuck you in turn on your favorite night light
To you everythings funny you got nothing to regret
Id give all I have honey
If you could stay like that

Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
I wont let nobody hurt you wont let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up never grow up

Youre in the car on the way to the movies
And youre mortified your moms dropping you off
At fourteen theres just so much you cant do
And you cant wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But dont make her drop you off around the block
Remember that shes getting older too
And dont lose the way that you dance around in your pjs getting ready for school

Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
No ones ever burned you nothings ever left you scarred
And even though you want to just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps remember the words said
And all your little brothers favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone

So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city they just dropped me off
Its so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on

Wish Id never grown up
I wish Id never grown up

Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I dont wanna grow up wish Id never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up just stay this little
Oh darling dont you ever grow up
Dont you ever grow up it could stay this simple
Wont let nobody hurt you
Wont let no one break your heart
And even though you want to please try to never grow up
Oh dont you ever grow up
Oh never grow up just never grow up

Song Name: Enchanted
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place

Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered Have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy

And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say Hey
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushing all the way home
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Please dont be in love with someone else
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Please dont have somebody waiting on you
Ill spend forever wondering if you knew
Please dont be in love with someone else
I was enchanted to meet you

Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waiting on you

Song Name: Better Than Revenge
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did

Time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you could say sabotage

I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress
Shes better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
She thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They wouldnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
Think about what you did

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress
Shes better known
For the things that she does
On the mattress

Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always get the last word

Shes not a saint
And shes not what you think
Shes an actress
She deserve it
Shes better known
For the things that she does on the mattress

Soon shes gonna find
Stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind
She should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
Cause I dont think you do
No no no no
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
I dont think you do
I dont think you do

Lets hear the applause
Come on come on
Come on show me how much better you are
So much better yeah
So you deserve some applause cause youre so much better

She took him faster than you could say sabotage

Song Name: Innocent
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your warpath
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin to get it back

Wasnt it easier in your lunchbox days
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasnt it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not where youve been
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Did some things you cant speak of
But at night you live it all again
You wouldnt be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasnt it easier in your fireflycatchin days
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasnt it beautiful runnin wild til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not what youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
Youll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up too
Lives change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

Its alright just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me
Oh who you are is not what youve been
Youre still an innocent
Its okay life is a tough crowd
32 and still growin up now
Who you are is not what you did
Youre still an innocent
Youre still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope
Its never too late to get it back

Song Name: Haunted
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought Id live to see it break
Its getting dark and its all too quiet
And I cant trust anything now
And its coming over you like its all a big mistake

Oh holding my breath
Wont lose you again
Somethings made your eyes go cold

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time Im wishing he was you instead

Oh holding my breath
Wont see you again
Something keeps me holding on to nothing

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre all I wanted
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back now Im haunted

I know I know I just know
Youre not gone You cant be gone No

Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish what you started
Come on come on dont leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant go back Im haunted

Oh

You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought Id see it break
Never thought Id see it


-----
Song Name: Last Kiss
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 158
The words that you whispered
For just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away
Away

I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane
That July 9th
The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

But now Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
Never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showing off again
And I roll my eyes and then
You pull me in
Im not much for dancing
But for you I did

Because I love your handshake meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions

And Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are

And I hope the sun shines
And its a beautiful day
And something reminds you
You wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So Ill go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is
I dont know how to be something you miss
I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last

Song Name: Long Live
I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew
Our lives would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

I said remember this feeling
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the sidelines wishing for right now

We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming This is absurd
Cause for a moment a band of thieves
In rippedup jeans got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment
Promise me this
That youll stand by me forever
But if God forbid fate should step in

And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell them my name

Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
Im not afraid

Singing long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day we will be remembered

Song Name: Ours
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here wed laugh about their vacant stares
But right now my time is theirs

Seems like theres always someone who disapproves
Theyll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jurys out but my choice is you

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I dont care cause right now youre mine

And youll say
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

And its not theirs to speculate
If its wrong and
Your hands are tough
But they are where mine belong and
Ill fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours

So dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Dont you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they cant take whats ours
They cant take whats ours

The stakes are high the waters rough
But this love is ours

Song Name: If This Was A Movie
Last night I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reaching
Even though I know youre not there
I was playing back a thousand memories baby
Thinking bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Locked up in your arms and our friends are laughing
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Not before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

If youre out there
If youre somewhere
If youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you
Ever since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door
And Id say

Come back come back come back to me like
You would before you said Its not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought youd be here by now whoa
Thought youd be here by now

Song Name: Superman
Tall dark and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
Its the same thing to me
Hes got his mothers eyes his fathers ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say

And you smile and say How are you
Ill say Just fine
I always forget to tell you I love you Ill love you forever

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall dark and beautiful
Hes complicated hes irrational
But I hope someday youll take me away and save the day yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin
Hes not all bad like his reputation
And I cant hear one single word they say

And youll leave got places to be
And Ill be OK
I always forget to tell you I love you I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you dont save some other girl
Dont forget dont forget about me
Im far away but I never let you go
Im lovestruck and looking out the window
Dont forget dont forget where Ill be
Right here wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
Youve got a busy day today
Go save the world Ill be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear Ill be with you someday
Ill be right here on the ground
When you come back down

When you come back down

Song Name: State Of Grace
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know
Is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never never saw you coming
And Ill never never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know
Is dont let go

We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs
Four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never never saw you coming
And Ill never never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never never saw you coming
And Ill never never be the same

And I never never saw you coming
And Ill never
So you were never a saint
Ive loved in shades of wrong
Be the same
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

Song Name: Red
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

Red red
Red red
Loving him was red
Red red
Red red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone whoa
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Red red
Oh red
Red red
Burning red
Red red
Red red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark grey all alone whoa
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red
Red red
Yeah yeah red
Red red
Were burning red
Red red
Red red

And thats why hes spinnin round in my head
Red red
Comes back to me burning red
Red red
Red red
Yeah yeah
Red red

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street

Song Name: Treacherous
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they dont touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Til the gravitys too much
And Ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And Id be smart to walk away
But youre quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it

I cant decide if its a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But youre friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you aget you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I I I I I I I I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you Ill get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I I I like it

Song Name: I Knew You Were Trouble
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

No apologies Hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been yeah
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been Never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in Knew it right there
So shame on me now Knew it right there
Flew me to places Id never been Ooh
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

Song Name: All Too Well
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone
And that magics not here no more
And I might be okay
But Im not fine at all

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on a teeball team
You tell me bout your past thinking your future was me

And I know its long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there I remember it all too well yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it cause you remember it all too well yeah

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uh uh uh uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uh uh uh uh

Instead of sleeping

Song Name: I Almost Do
I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you that I cant say Hello to you
And risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

Oh we made quite a mess babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if I wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that every time I dont
I almost do
I almost do

I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sitting in your chair by the window looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me

Song Name: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it Ive had enough cause like
We hadnt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space What
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear Im gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day

Ooh we called it off again last night

You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me

And me falling for it screaming that Im right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine

Ooh you called me up again tonight

Song Name: Stay Stay Stay
Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turnaway
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Okay lets talk

And I said
Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughin
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hangin out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me Id like to hang out with you for my whole life

Stay
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been lovin you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Thats so fun

Song Name: The Last Time
Gary Lightbody
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roadsthey lead me here

I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

Both
And right before your eyes
Im breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

Taylor Swift
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave

And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

Both
And right before your eyes
Im aching no past
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I wont hurt you anymore

Oh oh oh

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this

Song Name: Holy Ground
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York Time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light Go
Hey you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you

It was good never looking down
And right there where we stood was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance for all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance if Im not dancing with you

Song Name: Sad Beautiful Tragic
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons and darling they all look like me

Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Distance timing breakdown fighting
Silence the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up and for the life of us we cant get back

A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful

What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Song Name: The Lucky One
New to town with a made up name in the angels city
Chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

Now its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page

And they tell you that youre lucky
But youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights You wonder if youll make it out alive

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Can you tell me now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

Cause now my name is up in lights but I think you got it right

Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh

Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh

Song Name: Starlight
I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picked me up late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

He said Look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was tryna skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things

Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

Ooh ooh hes talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach them how to dream

Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things

Song Name: Begin Again
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song
But I do I do

Walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im coming off a little shy
But I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did

Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car and I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies that your family
Watches
Every single Christmas and I want to talk about that
And for the first time whats past is past

Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months

Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

Song Name: The Moment I Knew
You shouldve been there
Shouldve burst through the door
With that baby Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But theres one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said hed be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do when the one
Who means the most to you
Is the one who didnt show

You shouldve been here
And I wouldve been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all standing around me singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

Ooh I knew
Ooh

You called me later
And said Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said Im sorry too
And that was the moment I knew


-----
Song Name: Come Back... Be Here
You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself Dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would have played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away

New York be here
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here
Come back be here

Song Name: Girl At Home
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh uh
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I dont even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do whats upstanding and right
Its kinda like a code yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am noones exception
This I have previously learned

So dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh uh
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you got me alone
And I say
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadnt once been just like her

Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh uh
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone
And I say
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

Call a cab
Lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab
Lose my number
Lets consider this lesson learned

Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh uh
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that
Uh uh
Dont look at me
Youve got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
Everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadnt once been just like her

Song Name: Welcome To New York
Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadnt
Heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
Its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

I could dance to this beat beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me me
Welcome to New York
Its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

Welcome to New York
Its been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

But they never blind me me
Welcome to New York New York

But you know you wouldnt
Change anything anything

Song Name: Blank Space
Nice to meet you where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic madness heaven sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Loves a game wanna play
Ayy

New money suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Aint it funny Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey lets be friends
Im dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

Cherry lips crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses pretty lies
Youre the King baby Im your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait the worst is yet to come oh no

Screaming crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
Oh my God who is she
I get drunk on jealousy
But youll come back each time you leave
Cause darling Im a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya
Boys only want love if its torture
Dont say I didnt say I didnt warn ya

So its gonna be forever
Or its gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when its over mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause were young and were reckless
Well take this way too far
Itll leave you breathless hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of exlovers
Theyll tell you Im insane
But Ive got a blank space baby
And Ill write your name

Song Name: Style
Midnight
You come and pick me up no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view oh its been a while since I have even heard from you heard from you

I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go round and round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style

Song Name: Out Of The Woods
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together back together
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
And I remember thinkin

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Oh
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started cryin baby I did too
But when the sun came up I was lookin at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
I walked out and said Im settin you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were lookin at me

You were lookin at me
You were lookin at me

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
I remember
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Oh I remember

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Yeah
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet
Yeah
Are we in the clear yet
Yeah
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods

Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet

And people like me wanna believe you when you say youve changed
The more I think about it now the less I know

Song Name: I Wish You Would
Its 2 AM in your car
Windows down you pass my street the memories start
You say its in the past you drive straight ahead
Youre thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Id never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

Its 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane I think of you
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Id never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish
I I I I I I wish I wish

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would
I wish you would I wish you would

I wish I wish I

2 AM here we are
See your face hear my voice in the dark
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Id never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that Id never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here right now its all good

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood

Song Name: Wildest Dreams
He said Lets get out of this town
Drive out of this city away from the crowds
I thought Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha
Wildest dreams ah ha

I said No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
But this is gettin good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha Ha ha
Wildest dreams ah ha

Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin Burnin it It down Down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow Follow you You around
Follow you around

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just pretend

Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again

Song Name: This Love
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead ohoh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh oh

Tossing turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on on and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind only you
But you were still gone gone gone

Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead ohoh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me ohoh oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark ohoh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me ohoh oh

This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh

Your kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile my ghost
I fell to my knees
When youre young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead ohoh oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me ohoh oh
This love This love left a permanent mark
This love This love is glowing in the dark ohoh oh
This love These hands had to let it go free and
This love This love came back to me ohoh oh

Song Name: I Know Places
I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I

You stand with your hand on my waistline
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
It could burn out

Cause they got the cages they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places

Lights flash and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it
My love

Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails tryin to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots but were bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me its always you
I know places
In the dead of night your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you its always me
I know places

I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I

The drought was the very worst Ohoh ohoh
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth Ohoh ohoh
Youre still all over me
Like a winestained dress I cant wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Oh oh oh oh

There was nothing left to do Ohoh ohoh
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof Ohoh ohoh
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Oh oh oh oh
I think I am finally clean
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohoh
Said I think I am finally clean
Oh oh
Oh oh oh oh ohoh

Ten months sober I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older I wont give in
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst Ohoh ohoh
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
Oh

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean

Oh oh
Finally clean
Think Im finally clean
Oh oh
Ohoh ohoh
Oh oh oh
Think Im finally clean

Song Name: Wonderland
Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds

Oh

Didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh

Didnt they tell us dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile

Oh

Didnt it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind

But darling we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever last forever
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better never better
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it wonderland
And we pretended it could last forever in wonderland

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it wonderland
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland

Song Name: You Are In Love
One look dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof not much
But you saw enough
Small talk he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says Look up
And your shoulders brush
No proof one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
You can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
You can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love

Morning his place
Burnt toast Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses then says
Youre my best friend
And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
You can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
You can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
You are in love true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe round and round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why Ive spent my whole life trying to put it into words

Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love true love
Youre in love

You can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
You can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
You can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence silence silence silence you
You can feel it on the way home way home way home way home you
You can see it with the lights out lights out lights out lights out
You are in love true love
You are in love

Song Name: New Romantics
Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better

Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace

We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
Its so romantic its so romantic
Ah ah ah ah ah ah

Oh cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Cause baby I could build a castle castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Song Name: ...Ready For It?
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom some
Some boys are tryin too hard he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendettata

I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so I take my time
Are you ready for it

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief then he can join the heist and
Well move to an island and
And he can be my jailer Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now Im so very tame now
Never be the same now now

Touch me and youll never be alone

Song Name: I Did Something Bad
I never trust a narcissist but they love me
So I play em like a violin
And I make it lookohso easy

Cause for every lie I tell them they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimsonred paint on my lips
If a man talks shit
Then I owe him nothing
I dont regret it one bit
Cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good

I never trust a playboy but they love me
So I fly em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says Dont throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name
Then I owe him nothin
And if he spends my change
Then he had it comin

They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good

It just felt so good

Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
They got their pitchforks and proof their receipts and reasons

Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
So light me up light me up light me up light me up
Light me up go ahead and light me up light me up

Light me up light me up light me up light me up
Light me up light me up light me up

They say I did something bad oh
Then whys it feel so good so good
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good
Most fun I ever had most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good good

Oh you say I did something bad
You say I did something bad
Whys it feel so good good
So bad whys it feel so good
Whys it feel whys it feel so good bad
It just felt so good good

Song Name: Don't Blame Me
Dont blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doing it right
Lord save me
My drug is my baby
Ill be using for the rest of my life

Ive been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking pacing I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say Shes gone too far this time

Dont blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doing it right

My drug is my baby
Ill be using for the rest of my life

Dont blame me

And Im just gonna call you mine
Im insane but Im your baby your baby
Echoes echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy but now Im your daisy

And baby for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
Id beg you on my knees to stay

Dont blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doing it right

My drug is my baby
Ill be using for the rest of my life

Dont blame me

Song Name: Delicate
This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse so
You must like me for me
We cant make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side where you at
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes look at you

Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
Cause I know that its delicate

Third floor on the West Side me and you
Handsome youre a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here honey I dont wanna share

Cause I like you
This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse so
You must like me for me

Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink

Are you ever dreaming of me
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend youre mine all the damn time
Cause I like you

Cause I know that its delicate delicate

Song Name: Look What You Made Me Do
I dont like your little games
Dont like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool no I dont like you
I dont like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isnt cool no I dont like you Oh

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I dont like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast What
The world moves on another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on but one things for sure
Maybe I got mine but youll all get yours

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams

Ooh look what you made me do

Song Name: So It Goes...
See you in the dark
All eyes on you my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin trip trippin when youre gone

Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone its so simple
Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
Im so chill but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin skip skippin when Im gone

Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone its so simple
Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes

You did a number on me
But honestly baby whos counting
I did a number on you
But honestly baby whos counting
You did a number on me
But honestly baby whos counting
Whos counting
1 2 3

And all the pieces fall pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment caught up caught up
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep oh
And Im yours to lose baby
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes
Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes

Song Name: Gorgeous
Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend hes older than us
Hes in the club doing I dont know what
Youre so cool it makes me hate you so much I hate you so much

Whisky on ice Sunset and Vine
Youve ruined my life by not being mine

Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face
Cause look at your face Gorgeous
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say
Youre gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That Im talking to everyone here but you but you but you
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room dark room dark room
If you got a girlfriend Im jealous of her
But if youre single thats honestly worse
Cause youre so gorgeous it actually hurts
Honey it hurts

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face To your face
Cause look at your face Look at your face gorgeous
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way Feel this way
But what can I say
Youre gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad Mmh
You make me so happy it turns back to sad Yeah
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have and
Guess Ill just stumble on home to my cats Yeugh alone
Unless you wanna come along Oh

Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face To your face
Cause look at your face Look at your face gorgeous
And Im so furious Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way Feel this way
But what can I say I say

You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad Mmh

Song Name: Getaway Car
No nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didnt mean it
And you didnt see it
The ties were black the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Were riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No they never get far
No nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you werent thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us I was screaming Go go go
But with three of us honey its a sideshow
And a circus aint a love story
And now were both sorry were both sorry

X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Were riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No they never get far
No nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jetset Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
Its no surprise I turned you in
Cause us traitors never win

Im in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying but wed never get far Dont pretend
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Were riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart Shouldve known
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No they never get far
No nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

I made up my mind Im better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin me baby like tryin on clothes

Song Name: Dancing With Our Hands Tied
I I loved you in secret
First sight yeah we love without reason
Oh 25 years old
Oh how were you to know and

My my love had been frozen
Deep blue but you painted me golden
Oh and you held me close
Oh how was I to know what

I couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time
Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So baby can we dance
Oh through an avalanche
And say say that we got it
Im a mess but Im the mess that you wanted
Oh cause its gravity
Oh keeping you with me

I couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time
Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Ooh we had our hands tied
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again Again

Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Oh yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time First time first time
Yeah we were dancing Oh
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Dancing with our hands tied
Yeah we were dancing Ooh
And I had a bad feeling Had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

Oohooh oohooh
Hands tied hands tied Dancing

Song Name: Dress
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha haah

Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah

Inescapable Im not even gonna try
And if I get burned at least we were electrified
Im spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and were both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about

All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha haah

Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha

Haahah haahah haahahah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Haahah haahah haahahah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake I cant explain this
Ah ha ha haah

Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Song Name: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things
It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So whyd you have to rain on my parade
Im shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we cant have nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things honey Oh
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mindtwist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But Im not the only friend youve lost lately Mmmm
If only you werent so shady

This is why we cant have nice things darling Yeah
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice Nice things things Baby honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have

Heres a toast to my real friends
They dont care about the hesaid shesaid
And heres to my baby
He aint reading what they call me lately
And heres to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha I cant even say it with a straight face

This is why we cant have nice things darling Darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice Uhuh things Oh no honey Baby oh
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things darling
And heres to my real friends
Because you break them
I had to take them
And heres to my baby
Nice things honey
They didnt care about that hesaid shesaid
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things

Song Name: Call It What You Want
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but its alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobodys heard from me for months
Im doing better than I ever was

Cause
My babys fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
Im laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My babys fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain round my neck
Chain round my neck
Not because he owns me
But cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say I
I recall late November holding my breath
Slowly I said You dont need to save me
But would you run away with me
Yes would you run away

My babys fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
Im the one hes walking to
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to
My babys fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like Im brand new
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
So call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want to

Call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want call it what you want call it
Call it what you want yeah
Call it what you want

Song Name: New Year's Day
Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but

Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared
And youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home

Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong
Or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day

Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong
Or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day

Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please dont ever become a stranger
To the memories they will hold on to you
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Please dont ever become a stranger
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
I will hold on to you

Song Name: I Forgot That You Existed
How many days did I spend thinking
Bout how you did me wrong wrong wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing
Til all of my sunshine was gone gone gone
And I couldnt get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah
Your name on my lips tonguetied
Free rent living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down down down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground ground ground
And I wouldve stuck around for ya
Wouldve fought the whole town so yeah
Wouldve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
Its all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did I did I did
It isnt hate its just indifference
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
So yeah

Song Name: Cruel Summer
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it Oh yeah youre right I want it
Bad bad boy shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it Oh yeah youre right I want it

Killing me slow out the window

We say that well just screw it up in these trying times
Were not trying Oh yeah youre right I want it

So cut the headlights summers a knife
Im always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed youll be the last to know

And its ooh whoa oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh

And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar Oh

I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
He looks up grinning like a devil

And its ooh whoa oh

But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you

Said Im fine but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate Oh
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard

Song Name: Lover
We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
This is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now honey but I want em all

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my
Lover

And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
Darling youre my my my my
Lover

Song Name: The Man
I would be complex I would be cool
Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

Id be a fearless leader
Id be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
Whats that like

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man

Theyd say I hustled put in the work
They wouldnt shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me oh let the players play
Id be just like Leo in SaintTropez

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man

Whats it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And its all good if youre bad
And its okay if youre mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
Id be a bitch not a baller
Theyd paint me out to be bad
So its okay that Im mad

Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man You know that
And Im so sick of them coming at me again Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man
Then Id be the man Then Id be the man
Im so sick of running as fast as I can As fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man Hey
And Im so sick of them coming at me again Coming at me again
Cause if I was a man If I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man Oh
Id be the man Yeah
Id be the man Id be the man

If I was a man then Id be the man

Song Name: The Archer
Combat
Im ready for combat
I say I dont want that
But what if I do

Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
Ive got a hundred thrownout speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
Its getting so old
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if Im alright
Right right right here

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Screaming Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay

I see right through me I see right through me

Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the kings horses
All the kings men
Couldnt put me together again
Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

Ive been the archer
Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay

I see right through me I see right through me

Who could stay
Who could stay
Who could stay
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
Im ready for combat

Lead to where I cant stop
Go there every night

Song Name: Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince
You know I adore you Im crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens marching band playing
Im lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now Im feeling hopeless ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life Ah

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
Its been a long time coming but

Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay
Were so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
Im feeling helpless the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then where are the wise men
Darling Im scared Ah

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
And now the storm is coming but

Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl Okay
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay
Were so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I dont want you to Go I dont really wanna Fight
Cause nobodys gonna Win I think you should come home
And I dont want you to Go I dont really wanna Fight
Cause nobodys gonna Win I think you should come home
And I dont want you to Go I dont really wanna Fight
Cause nobodys gonna Win I just thought you should know
And Ill never let you Go cause I know this is a Fight
That someday were gonna Win

Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl
Oh I just thought you should know You should know
Its you and me theres nothing like this Like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince Okay
Were so sad we paint the town blue Paint it blue

Song Name: Paper Rings
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now Ive read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Ayy
Kiss me once cause you know I had a long night Oh
Kiss me twice cause its gonna be alright Uh
Three times cause I waited my whole life 1 2 1 2 3 4

I like shiny things but Id marry you with paper rings
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre the one I want and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh youre the one I want

In the winter in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first I went in too
Im with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brothers wall
Honey without all the exes fights and flaws
We wouldnt be standing here so tall so

Ayy
Kiss you once cause I know you had a long night Oh
Kiss you twice cause its gonna be alright Uh
Three times cause you waited your whole life 1 2 1 2 3 4
Ah

I like shiny things but Id marry you with paper rings

I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me baby boy

Wrap your arms around me baby boy

Song Name: Cornelia Street
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open autumn air
Jacket round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof you and I

I hope I never lose you hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Thats the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion listen

I hope I never lose you
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh never again
And baby I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby Im so terrified of if you ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
Id never walk Cornelia Street again

I dont wanna lose you Hope it never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street again
I dont wanna lose you Yeah

I rent a place on Cornelia Street
I say casually in the car

Song Name: Death By A Thousand Cuts
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love one for the ages
But if the storys over why am I still writing pages

Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not

Its death by a thousand cuts

My heart my hips my body my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs our films united we stand
Our country guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paperthin plans
My time my wine my spirit my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you so much but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright its just a thousand cuts

I get drunk but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No its not
Its death by a thousand cuts You didnt touch

Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
My body my love my trust Its death by a thousand cuts
But it wasnt enough it wasnt enough no no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say I dont know

Song Name: London Boy
Idris Elba and James Corden
We can go driving in on my scooter
Uh you know just round London
Alright yeah

I love my hometown as much as Motown I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen faded blue jeans Tennessee whiskey
But something happened I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But thats not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy I fancy you Ooh

And now I love high tea stories from Uni and the West End
You can find me in the pub we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky a rainy cab ride
Babes dont threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God I love the English

You know I love a London boy I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy I fancy you

So please show me Hackney
Doesnt have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me Im your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you Wanna be with you
Wanna be with you Oh

You know I love a London boy I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon Yeah
He likes my American smile like a child when our eyes meet
Darling I fancy you You
Took me back to Highgate met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true Yeah

Song Name: Soon You'll Get Better
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctors office lighting I didnt tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isnt real
Ill paint the kitchen neon Ill brighten up the sky
I know Ill never get it theres not a day that I wont try
And I say to you

Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to
What am I supposed to do
If theres no you

This wont go back to normal if it ever was
Its been years of hoping and I keep saying it because
Cause I have to

Oohah
Youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to

Song Name: False God
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said Id die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how Id fly to you

And I cant talk to you when youre like this
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
Im New York City I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love

I know heavens a thing
I go there when you touch me honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you cant talk to me when Im like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
Youre the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love ah

Still worship this love
Even if its a false god
Even if its a false god
Still worship this love

Song Name: You Need To Calm Down
You are somebody that I dont know
But youre taking shots at me like its Patrón
And Im just like Damn
Its 7 AM

Say it in the street thats a knockout
But you say it in a tweet thats a copout
And Im just like Hey
Are you OK

And I aint tryna mess with your selfexpression
But Ive learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud
And Im just like
Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we dont know
But youre coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD
You could be GLAAD

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Mustve taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud
And Im just like
Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down
You need to calm down
Youre being too loud
Youre being too loud
And Im just like
Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to just stop
Can you stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down

Song Name: Afterglow
I blew things out of proportion now youre blue
Put you in jail for something you didnt do
I pinned your hands behind your back oh
Thought I had reason to attack but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry til it blows up til theres no us
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
Its on your face and Im to blame I need to say

Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you Ooh
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow

Its so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight oh

I lived like an island punished you with silence
Went off like sirens just crying
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
Its on your face dont walk away I need to say

Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Im sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you Ooh
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that youre still mine
Tell me that well be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that its not my fault
Tell me that Im all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you Ooh
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you Ooh
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow

Song Name: It's Nice To Have A Friend
Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves you give me one
Wanna hang out Yeah sounds like fun
Video games you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down no curfew
20 questions we tell the truth
Youve been stressed out lately yeah me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh

Church bells ring carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff call you Babe
Have my back yeah every day
Feels like home stay in bed
The whole weekend

Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh
Its nice to have a friend Ooh

Song Name: Daylight
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that Ive crossed unforgiven
Ill tell you the truth but never goodbye

I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Ive been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night
And now I see daylight I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe Ive stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because its morning now
Its brighter now now

I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
Ive been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night
Now Im wide awake
And now I see daylight daylight I only see daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight

And I can still see it all In my mind
All of you all of me Intertwined
I once believed love would be Black and white
But its golden Golden
And I can still see it all In my head
Back and forth from New York Sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be Burning red
But its golden
Like daylight like daylight
Like daylight daylight

I dont wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I can never look away
I dont wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Things will never be the same
Ive been sleeping so long in a twentyyear dark night
Now Im wide awake
And now I see daylight I see daylight I only see daylight Ah
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight Ah
And I can still see it all
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
And I can still see it all back and forth from New York
I only see daylight daylight daylight daylight
I once believed love would be burning red

Like daylight
Its golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that Im afraid of Im afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I I just think that
You are what you love

Song Name: the 1
Im doing good Im on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop I didnt though

I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know never know
And if you wanted me you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed youre never gonna grow
And its alright now

But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one

I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know never know
And its another day waking up alone

But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one

Hey yeahyeah
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today

We were something dont you think so
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one

Song Name: cardigan
Vintage tee brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancing in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby kiss it better I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hideandseek and
Giving me your weekends
I I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleeding

Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water I
And when you are young they assume you know nothing

But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my whatifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Song Name: the last great american dynasty
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said How did a middleclass divorcée do it

The wedding was charming if a little gauche
Theres only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it Holiday House
Their parties were tasteful if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows if she never showed up what couldve been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits and then it was bought by me

Who knows if I never showed up what couldve been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time

Song Name: exile
Justin Vernon
I can see you standin honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin but the jokes not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin now
You were my town
Now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before

Hoo hooooh
Hoo hooooh
Hoo hooooh

Taylor Swift
I can see you starin honey
Like hes just your understudy
Like youd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Balancin on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Im not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown
Now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leavin out the side door

Justin Vernon Taylor Swift
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out You didnt even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs

All this time
I never learned to read your mind Never learned to read my mind
I couldnt turn things around You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
So many signs
So many signs You didnt even see the signs

I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town
Now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out didnt even hear me out
You never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs

All this time
I never learned to read your mind Never learned to read my mind
I couldnt turn things around You never turned things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign I gave so many signs
You never gave a warning sign All this time
So many times I never learned to read your mind
So many signs I couldnt turn things around I couldnt turn things around
Cause you never gave a warning sign You never gave a warning sign
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah

Song Name: my tears ricochet
We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if Im on fire
Youll be made of ashes too

Even on my worst day
Did I deserve babe
All the hell you gave me
Cause I loved you
I swear I loved you
Til my dying day

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And youre the hero flying around saving face
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones
Never knowing what theyll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when Id fight you used to tell me I was brave
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim for my heart go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When Im screaming at the sky
And when you cant sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And youre cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

Song Name: mirrorball
I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
Ill get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break its in a million pieces

Hush
When no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush
When no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
Im still on that tightrope
Im still trying everything to get you laughing at me
Im still a believer but I dont know why
Ive never been a natural
All I do is try try try
Im still on that trapeze
Im still trying everything
To keep you looking at me

Because Im a mirrorball
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself
Tonight

Song Name: seven
Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in but I I was high
In the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart wont tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And Ive been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you wont have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream
Ferociously
Any time I wanted
I I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart wont tell no other
And though I cant recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
Well move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long

Song Name: august
Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of Are you sure
Never have I ever before

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when youre back at school
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case youd call
And say Meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying Us
Cause you werent mine to lose
You werent mine to lose
No

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
Cause you were never mine mine

Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember
Remember when I pulled up
And said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans
Just in case youd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall

Remember when I pulled up
And said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans
Just in case youd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
Meet me behind the mall

Remember when I pulled up
And said Get in the car
And then canceled my plans
Just in case youd call
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all

Song Name: this is me trying
Ive been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting
I didnt know if youd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Couldve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
But Im here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when Im mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pourin out my heart to a stranger
But I didnt pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least Im trying

And its hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
Its hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying And maybe I dont quite know what to say
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least Im trying

Song Name: illicit affairs
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends youre out for a run
Youll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
Its born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
a million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
a million little times

And you wanna scream
Dont call me kid
Dont call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else
Dont call me kid
Dont call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
a million little times

Song Name: invisible string
Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time
Curious time
Gave me no compasses
Gave me no signs
Were there clues I didnt see
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our threeyear trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time
Mystical time
Cutting me open then healing me fine
Were there clues I didnt see
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time
Wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purplepink skies
And its cool
Baby with me
And isnt it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me

Oohoohoohooh
Me
Oohoohoohooh

Ahahah
Ahahah

Song Name: mad woman
What did you think Id say to that
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will

What do you sing on your drive home
Do you see my face in the neighbors lawn
Does she smile
Or does she mouth Fuck you forever

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say move on
But you know I wont
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
Its obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that
And when you say I seem angry I get more angry
And theres nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And youll poke that bear til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And theres nothing like a mad woman

Im taking my time
Taking my time
Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad

You made her like that

Song Name: epiphany
Keep your helmet
Keep your life son
Just a flesh wound
Heres your rifle

Crawling up the beaches now
Sir I think hes bleeding out
And some things you just cant speak about

With you I serve
With you I fall down
Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin out
Out

Something med school
Did not cover
Someones daughter
Someones mother

Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc I think shes crashing out
And some things you just cant speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen

With you I serve
With you I fall down
Down Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin out
Out

With you I serve
With you I serve
With you I fall down Down
Down Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin out Out
Out Out

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen

Song Name: betty
Betty I wont make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom
But I think its cause of me
Betty one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house
Its like I couldnt breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
Im only seventeen
I dont know anything but I know I miss you

Betty I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found I hate the crowds you know that
Plus I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You cant believe a word she says
Most times but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me
Would you want me
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing
Im only seventeen
I dont know anything but I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said James get in lets drive
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty Im here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now but its finally sinking in
Betty right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So I showed up at your party
Yeah I showed up at your party
Yeah I showed up at your party
Will you have me
Will you love me
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it Will it patch your broken wings
Im only seventeen
I dont know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight you know I miss you

Song Name: peace
Our comingofage has come and gone
Suddenly this summer its clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And its just around the corner darlin
Cause it lives in me
No I could never give you peace

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
Its like Im wastin your honor

And you know that Id
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But theres robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
Id give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If youre standing with me

But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace

Song Name: hoax
My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax
I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming Give me a reason
Your faithless loves the only hoax
I believe in
Dont want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died so whats the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so whats the point of keeping score
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart

Dont want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

Song Name: the lakes
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me
Im not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heartstopping waves of hurt
Ive come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
Cause I havent moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I dont belong and my beloved neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
Im setting off but not without my muse
No not without you


-----
Song Name: willow
Im like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an openshut case
I never wouldve known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize Id cheat to win

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90s trend

Wait for the signal and Ill meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an openshut case
I guess I shouldve known from the look on your face
Every baitandswitch was a work of art

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

The more that you say the less I know
Wherever you stray I follow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Hey thats my man
Thats my man
Yeah thats my man
Every baitandswitch was a work of art
Thats my man
Hey thats my man
Im begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans thats my man

Song Name: champagne problems
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
Youre not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldnt keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no ones celebrating

Dom Pérignon you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech youre speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldnt give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
This dorm was once a madhouse
I made a joke Well its made for me
How evergreen our group of friends
Dont think well say that word again
And soon theyll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just dont know the answer
Til someones on their knees and asks you
She wouldve made such a lovely bride
What a shame shes fucked in the head they said
But youll find the real thing instead
Shell patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your moms ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You wont remember all my
Champagne problems

You wont remember all my
Champagne problems

Song Name: gold rush
Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipating my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles Tshirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
Cause it could never be

Cause I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipating my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I dont like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I cant dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
I wont call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
Cause it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
Cause it will never be
Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

Song Name: 'tis the damn season
If I wanted to know
Who you were hanging with
While I was gone I wouldve asked you
Its the kind of cold
Fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
Theres an ache in you
Put there by the ache in me
But if its all the same to you
Its the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
Tis the damn season write this down
Im staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parked my car
Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too
Remember how you watched me leave
But if its okay with you
Its okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
Tis the damn season write this down
Im staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day
Just for old times sake
I wont ask you to wait
If you dont ask me to stay
So Ill go back to LA
And the socalled friends wholl write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles Im faking
And the heart I know Im breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed Ive ever known

We could call it even
Even though Im leaving
And Ill be yours for the weekend
Tis the damn season

We could call it even
You could call me babe for the weekend
Tis the damn season write this down
Im staying at my parents house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now Im missing your smile hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown

Song Name: tolerate it
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you I notice everything you do or dont do
Youre so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle heros welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
Youre so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds where was I
Wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple my mural my sky
Now Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume Im fine
But what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me I could do it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you

Estes a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Estes been losing sleep
Her husbands acting different and it smells like infidelity
She says That aint my Merlot on his mouth
That aint my jewelry on our joint account
No there aint no doubt
I think Im gonna call him out
She says

Taylor Swift and HAIM
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
No no body no crime
But I aint letting up until the day I die

No no
I think he did it
No no

Taylor Swift
Este wasnt there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Estes bed and everything
No there aint no doubt
Somebodys gotta catch him out
Cause

Taylor Swift and HAIM
I think he did it but I just cant prove it He did it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15
And Ive cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Estes sisters gonna swear she was with me She was with me dude
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

Taylor Swift
They think she did it but they just cant prove it
They think she did it but they just cant prove it
She thinks I did it but she just cant prove it

No no body no crime
I wasnt letting up until the day he
No no body no crime
I wasnt letting up until the day he
No no body no crime
I wasnt letting up until the day he

Song Name: happiness
Honey when Im above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now Im right down in it all the years Ive given
Is just shit were dividin up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief I cant face reinvention
I havent met the new me yet

Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That wouldve loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt
I hope shell be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No I didnt mean that
Sorry I cant see facts through all of my fury
You havent met the new me yet

Therell be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things I believe
There is happiness

In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I cant make it go away by making you a villain
I guess its the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

Honey when Im above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You havent met the new me yet
And I think shell give you that

Therell be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight leave it all behind
Oh leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Song Name: dorothea
Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screens the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Oooh
But you wont like it that way

Its never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know that youll always know me
Dorothea
Dorothea

Ooh youre a queen
Selling dreams
Selling makeup and magazines
Ooh from you Id buy anything

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers Well

Oooh
I guess Ill never know
Oooh
And youll go on with the show

But its never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know youll always know me

Dorothea
Dorothea

Oooh
Oooh
Oohwoooohoohooh oohoohoohooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oohwoooohoohooh oohoohooh

Song Name: coney island
Taylor Swift
Break my soul in two
Looking for you but youre right here
If I cant relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to
And if this is the long haul
Howd we get here so soon
Did I close my fist around something delicate
Did I shatter you

And Im sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Matt Berninger and Taylor Swift
The question pounds my head
Whats a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there
Will you forgive my soul
When youre too wise to trust me and too old to care
Cause we were like the mall before the Internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

Im on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go
The fast times the bright lights the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my
Making you my
Making you my centerfold

Id meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faithforgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I dont I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
Hes in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants whats only yours

Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon coast is clear
Spring breaks loose but so does fear
Hes gonna burn this house to the ground

Hows one to know
Id live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what well become
And drink my husbands wine

Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
And Im covered in you

So yeah its a fire
Its a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah its a war
Its the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered
In you
In you
Now Im covered in you
In you

Song Name: cowboy like me
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tentlike thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said Dancin is a dangerous game

Oh I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
Im never gonna love again

Ive got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now Im waiting by the phone
Like Im sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it

Youre a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that Ive swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

Ive had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me
And Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again

Song Name: long story short
Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles
Til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits walk in it
Til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy
Now Im all about you
Im all about you
Im all about you

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time Im ready

Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short it was the wrong guy
Now Im all about you
Im all about you
Im all about you

No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
No more tug of war
Now I just know theres more Know theres more
No more keepin score
Now I just keep you warm Keep you warm
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses will defeat themselves
Before you get the chance to swing
And hes passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits walk in it
Everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short I survived
Now Im all about you
And now Im all about you ah
And now Im all about you
And now Im all about you ah
Yeah yeah
Im all about you
And now Yeah yeah
Im all about you

Long story short it was a bad time
Long story short I survived

Song Name: marjorie
Never be so kind you forget to be clever
Never be so clever you forget to be kind

And if I didnt know better
Id think you were talking to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive

Never be so polite you forget your power
Never wield such power you forget to be polite

And if I didnt know better
Id think you were listening to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
Youd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I shouldve asked you questions
I shouldve asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive
And if I didnt know better
Id think you were singing to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But youre still around

Song Name: closure
Its been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasnt right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over
I dont need your closure
Your closure

Dont treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
Im fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over
I dont need your closure
Your closure
Your closure
Your closure

I know Im just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying friends
Would iron it out so nice
Guilty guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But its fake
And its oh so unnecessary

Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes I got your letter
Yes Im doing better
I know that its over
I dont need your closure
Closure
Your closure
Your closure

Song Name: evermore
Taylor Swift
Gray November
Ive been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light

I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
What I used to fight for

I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be doublecrossed

Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon
And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
Evermore

Justin Vernon
Cant not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh can we just get a pause
To be certain well be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
Im on waves out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross

Taylor Swift and Justin Vernon
And when I was shipwrecked Cant think of all the cost
I thought of you All the things that will be lost now
In the cracks of light Can we just get a pause
I dreamed of you To be certain well be tall again
If you think of all the costs
It was real enough Whether weather be the frost
To get me through Or the violence of the dog days
Or the violence of the dog days
Out on waves being tossed
Im on waves out being tossed
I swear Is there a line that we could just go cross
You were there

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldnt be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldnt be for evermore
Evermore

Song Name: right where you left me
Friends break up friends get married
Strangers get born strangers get buried
Trends change rumors fly through new skies
But Im right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But Im right where you left me

Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Crosslegged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinnedup hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective but I sat and stared
Right where you left me

You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me you left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else she wont know it
Shes still twentythree inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day you dont have to lose it
Shes still twentythree inside her fantasy
And youre sitting in front of me

At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Crosslegged in the dim light
Everything was just right I
I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Crosslegged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight I
I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinnedup hair
Im sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas but Im unaware
Cause Im right where
I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I cant bear witness
And its been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

Im right where
You left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Song Name: it's time to go
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again hes insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed not a twin from your dreams
Shes a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when its time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years fifteen million tears
Begging til my knees bled
I gave it my all he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
Hes got my past frozen behind glass
But Ive got me

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when its time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When its time to go
You know you know you know you know
When its time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

Song Name: Fearless (Taylor's Version)
Theres something bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot yeah
Oh yeah

Were driving down the road I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

So baby drive slow til we run out of road in this onehorse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
Oh oh

Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss its flawless really something
Its fearless
Oh yeah

Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless

Oh oh
Ohoh yeah

Song Name: Fifteen (Taylor's Version)
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
Its the mornin of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you aint seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybodys way
Its your freshman year and youre gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
You know I havent seen you around before

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen feelin like theres nothin to figure out
Well count to ten take it in
This is life before you know who youre gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough youre best friends
Laughin at the other girls who think theyre so cool
Well be outta here as soon as we can
And then youre on your very first date and hes got a car
And youre feelin like flyin
And your mamas waitin up and youre thinkin hes the one
And youre dancin round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round
But in your life youll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didnt know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

Cause when youre fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
Youre gonna believe them
And when youre fifteen dont forget to look before you fall
Ive found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who youre supposed to be
I didnt know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala lalalala
Lalala lalala

Your very first day
Take a deep breath girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

Song Name: Love Story (Taylor's Version)
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go and I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you

Song Name: Hey Stephen (Taylor's Version)
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm yeah

Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Hey Stephen Ive been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
Ive seen it all so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same

Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Theyre dimming the street lights youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine
Hey Stephen I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you Hahaha

I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself

Ahuh myself
Mmmmm I cant help myself
I cant help myself
Ohohoh
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm

Song Name: White Horse (Taylor's Version)
Say youre sorry that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on the days drag on
Stupid girl I shoulda known I shoulda known

That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naïve got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know

That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But Im so sorry

Cause Im not your princess this aint our fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now oh
Its too late to catch me now


-----
Song Name: You Belong With Me (Taylor's Version)
Youre on the phone with your girlfriend shes upset
Shes going off about something that you said
Cause she doesnt get your humor like I do
Im in my room its a typical Tuesday night
Im listening to the kind of music she doesnt like
And shell never know your story like I do

Cause she wears short skirts I wear Tshirts
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming bout the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your wornout jeans
I cant help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
Hey isnt this easy
And youve got a smile that could light up this whole town
I havent seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say youre fine I know you better than that
Hey whatcha doing with a girl like that

She wears high heels I wear sneakers
Shes Cheer Captain and Im on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what youre looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me

Oh I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
Im the one who makes you laugh
When you know youre bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know its with me

Cant you see that Im the one who understands you
Been here all along so why cant you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me

Song Name: Breathe (Taylor's Version)
Taylor Swift
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But its killing me to see you go after all this time

Mmmm mmmmmmmm
Mmmm mmmmmmmm

Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
Its the kind of ending you dont really wanna see
Cause its tragedy and itll only bring you down
Now I dont know what to be without you around

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Never wanted this never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesnt work out
And nothin we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me
Youre the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know its not easy easy for me
Its 2 AM feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this aint easy easy for me

And we know its never simple never easy
Never a clean break no one here to save me oh

I cant breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Im sorry Im sorry Mmm
Im sorry Yeah yeah Im sorry
Im sorry Im sorry Ooh ooh
Im sorry

Song Name: Tell Me Why (Taylor's Version)
I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof but Im not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why

Well you could write a book on
How to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im tryin to say oh

Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind

Im sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doin to me
Tell me why Why
Tell me why Oh

I take a step back I let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know


-----
Song Name: You're Not Sorry (Taylor's Version)
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long baby but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again but not this time around

You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh

Youre looking so innocent I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know oh
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before

But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh

You had me crawling for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade

So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh

No no no no no no no no no no no no
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh no no no no no no

Song Name: The Way I Loved You (Taylor's Version)
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and its like
I couldnt ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says You look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you act insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
Hes close to my mother
Talks business with my father
Hes charming and endearing
And Im comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Youre so in love that you acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

He cant see the smile Im faking
And my hearts not breaking
Cause Im not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
Its 2 AM and Im cursing your name
Im so in love that I acted insane
And thats the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
Its a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you oh oh

Whoa whoa ohoh oh
And thats the way I loved you oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And thats the way I loved you

Song Name: Forever & Always (Taylor's Version)
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down we almost never speak
I dont feel welcome anymore
Baby what happened Please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect
Now youre halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always

Was I out of line
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now Im not so sure
So heres to everything coming down to nothing
Heres to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute but I dont anymore

And I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said Forever and always
Oh and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby I dont think so

Oh back up baby back up
Did you forget everything
Back up baby back up
Did you forget everything

Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
Oh I stare at the phone he still hasnt called
And then you feel so low you cant feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said Forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when youre here and it rains when youre gone
Cause I was there when you said Forever and always
You didnt mean it baby
You said Forever and always yeah

Song Name: The Best Day (Taylor's Version)
Im five years old its getting cold Ive got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I dont know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know youre not scared of anything at all
Dont know if Snow Whites house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

Im thirteen now
And dont know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop til Ive forgotten all their names

I dont know who Im going to talk to now at school
But I know Im laughing on the car ride home with you
Dont know how long its going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother inside and out
Hes better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and youre talking to me
Its the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddys smart
And youre the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didnt know if you knew so Im taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today

Song Name: Change (Taylor's Version)
Well its a sad picture the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know its all the same another time and place
Repeating history and youre getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And Ill do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh

So weve been outnumbered raided and now cornered
Its hard to fight when the fight aint fair
Were getting stronger now find things they never found
They might be bigger but were faster and never scared
You can walk away say we dont need this
But theres something in your eyes says we can beat this

Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution the time will come
For us to finally win
And well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh

Tonight well stand get off our knees
Fight for what weve worked for all these years
And the battle was long its the fight of our lives
But well stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
Its a revolution throw your hands up
Cause we never gave in
And well sing hallelujah we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah

Song Name: Jump Then Fall (Taylor's Version)
I like the way you sound in the morning
Were on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I cant keep my focus
I watch you talk you didnt notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face oh
Ive never been so wrapped up honey
I like the way youre everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oover
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

Cause every time you smile I smile
And every time you shine Ill shine for you

Whoa oh Im feeling you baby
Dont be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottoms gonna drop out from under our feet
Ill catch you Ill catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
Ill catch you
The time is gonna come when youre so mad you could cry
But Ill hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh I need you baby
Dont be afraid please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby Im never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
Cause Ima stay through it all

Song Name: Untouchable (Taylor's Version)
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you Im caught up in you

Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven

Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway

But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven

Im caught up in you
Ohoh oh ohoh
But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on oh come on come on
Come on come on oh oh oh

Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
Theyre spelling out your name oh

Song Name: Come In With The Rain (Taylor's Version)
I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I dont wanna have to go that far
And I Ive got you down I know you by heart
And you dont even know where I start

Talk to yourself talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And dont wait for the sky to clear

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night to call your name
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

Ive watched you so long screamed your name
I dont know what else I can say

Ill leave my window open
Cause Im too tired at night for all these games
Just know Im right here hoping
That youll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I dont wanna go there anymore

Song Name: Superstar (Taylor's Version)
This is wrong but I cant help but feel like
There aint nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I cant
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
Id be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant keep my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Morning loneliness
Comes around when Im not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
Youll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
Id be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

You played in bars you play guitar
And Im invisible and everyone knows who you are
And youll never see you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight tell me things like
I cant take my eyes off of you
Im no one special just another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall superstar

Sweet sweet superstar
Superstar

Song Name: The Other Side Of The Door (Taylor's Version)
In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin words that you were sayin
Tryna make me stay
I said This time Ive had enough
And youve called a hundred times
But Im not picking up

Cause Im so mad I might tell you that its over
But if you look a little closer

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone
Goin through the photographs starin at the phone
I keep goin back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh babe if you know everything
Tell me why you couldnt see
When I left I wanted you to chase after me yeah

I said Leave but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And Ill scream out the window
I cant even look at you
I dont need you but I do I do I do
I say Theres nothing you can say
To make this right again I mean it I mean it
But what I mean is

I said Leave but baby all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin pebbles
Screamin Im in love with you
Wait there in the pourin rain comin back for more
And dont you leave cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying was she worth this mess
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess I need you

Song Name: Today Was A Fairytale (Taylor's Version)
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey tshirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around

Can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
Youve got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now its getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around
I can feel my heart
Its beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I cant put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Song Name: You All Over Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
Taylor Swift
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldnt I find a stain but I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know you can scratch it right off
Its how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket its been spent and traded in
You cant change where its been
Reminds me of me

Taylor Swift and Maren Morris
I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on
God knows too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your Dont you wish you had me grin
Well I did so I smiled and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived and I learned
Had you got burned
Held out and held on
God knows too long
And wasted time lost tears
Swore that Id get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me

I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
Ive still got you all over me
Ive still got you all over me
Still got you all over me

Song Name: Mr. Perfectly Fine (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
Mr Perfect face
Mr Here to stay
Mr Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
Everything was right
Mr Ive been waiting for you all my life
Mr Every single day until the end I will be by your side

But that was when I got to know Mr Change of heart
Mr Leaves me all alone I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But its wonderful to see that youre okay

Hello Mr Perfectly fine
Hows your heart after breaking mine
Mr Always at the right place at the right time baby
Hello Mr Casually cruel
Mr Everything revolves around you
Ive been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And youre Mr Perfectly fine

Mr Never told me why
Mr Never had to see me cry
Mr Insincere apology so he doesnt look like the bad guy
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well I thought you might be different than the rest I guess youre all the same

Cause I hear hes got his arm round a brandnew girl
Ive been pickin up my heart hes been pickin up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But its wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello Mr Perfectly fine
Hows your heart after breakin mine
Mr Always at the right place at the right time baby
Hello Mr Casually cruel
Mr Everything revolves around you
Ive been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And youre Mr Perfectly fine

So dignified in your wellpressed suit
So strategized all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
Its the best seat in the best room
Oh hes so smug Mr Always wins
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And its really such a shame
Its such a shame
Cause I was Miss Here to stay
Now Im Miss Gonna be alright someday
And someday maybe youll miss me
But by then youll be Mr Too late

Goodbye Mr Perfectly fine
Hows your heart after breakin mine
Mr Always at the right place at the right time baby
Goodbye Mr Casually cruel
Mr Everything revolves around you
Ive been Miss Misery for the last time
And youre Mr Perfectly fine
Youre perfectly fine
Mr Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away
You said youd never go away

Song Name: We Were Happy (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby it was good baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
Thats sorta how I feel right now
And goodbyes so much harder cause we were happy

When it was good baby it was good baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh I hate those voices telling me Im not in love anymore
But they dont give me choices and thats what these tears are for
Cause we were happy we were happy

When it was good baby it was good baby
We showed em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah we were happy
Ohoh ohohoh
We were happy

Hey I knew Id run into you somewhere

Song Name: Bye Bye Baby (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin
Im driving away and I I guess you could say
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I I still love you but I cant

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought wed always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like Im becoming a part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Bye bye baby

And theres so much that I cant touch
Youre all I want but its not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And Im so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
Cause you took me home but you just couldnt keep me
Oh you took me home I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby

Song Name: State Of Grace (Taylor's Version)
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same oh
And I never saw you coming
And Ill never be the same
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

Song Name: Red (Taylor's Version)
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
But loving him was red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

Red red red
Red red red
Oh red Red red red
Red red red
Burning red Red red red
Red red red
Red red red
Red red red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red

Oh losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone Woah
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red

Red red red red red red
Yeah yeah red
Red red red red red red
Burning red Red red red red red red
Red red red red red red

And thats why hes spinning round in my head Red red red red red red
Comes back to me Red red red red red red burning red
Red red red red red red Yeah yeah
Red red red red red red

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a deadend street

Song Name: Treacherous (Taylor's Version)
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they dont touch
Out of focus eye to eye
Till the gravitys too much
And Ill do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And Id be smart to walk away
But youre quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it

I cant decide if its a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But youre friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I I I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I I I
I I I
I I I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home
Ill follow you follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I I I like it

Song Name: I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor's Version)
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble

No apologies hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in Oh
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been Yeah
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh ohoh Yeah
Trouble trouble trouble Trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been Never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in Knew it right there
So shame on me now Knew it right there
Flew me to places Id never been Ooh
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground

Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble Oh
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble Trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

Song Name: All Too Well (Taylor's Version)
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition
And my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know its long gone and that magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all ohohoh

Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past thinking your future was me
And I know its long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all too well

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there you remember it all
Down the stairs you were there you remember it all
It was rare I was there I remember it all too well

Song Name: I Almost Do (Taylor's Version)
I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder bout me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont

And I confess baby
In my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if Id want to try again with you
And I almost do

Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont

I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder bout me

Song Name: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor's Version)
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it Ive had enough cause like
We hadnt seen each other in a month

Song Name: Stay Stay Stay (Taylor's Version)
Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet and said Ok lets talk
And I said

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didnt leave
Its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
Stay stay stay stay stay

Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay

Thats so fun

Song Name: The Last Time (Taylor's Version)
I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
Im breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
Im aching
No past nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye

This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I wont hurt you anymore
Ohho ohho ohho ohho
Ohho ohho ohho ohho

This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
You break my heart
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this

Song Name: Holy Ground (Taylor's Version)
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a firstglance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke wed made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of I need you
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the storys got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

Cause darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight Im gonna dance
For all that weve been through
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I dont wanna dance
If Im not dancing with you

Song Name: Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor's Version)
Long handwritten note deep in your pocket
Words how little they mean when youre a little too late
I stood right by the tracks your face in a locket
Good girls hopeful theyll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

In dreams I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And youve got your demons
And darling they all look like me

Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair Whoa oh whoa oh

Distance timing breakdown fighting
Silence the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me try to fix it could you just try to listen
Hang up give up and for the life of us we cant get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic beautiful tragic beautiful

What we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad beautiful tragic love affair

Song Name: The Lucky One (Taylor's Version)
New to town with a made up name
In the angels city chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
So overnight you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one
Oh oh oh

Now its big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesnt even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that youre lucky but youre so confused
Cause you dont feel pretty you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if youll make it out alive

And theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
But can you tell me now youre the lucky one
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh

It was a few years later I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time but I understand it now

Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Yeah theyll tell you now youre the lucky one
Let me tell you now youre the lucky one oh oh oh
Oh oh whoa oh oh

Song Name: Everything Has Changed (Taylor's Version)
You good to go

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didnt before
And all Ive seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall painted blue
But Ill take em down take em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind making up for lost time
Taking flight making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

Cause all I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
Youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday

Come back and tell me why
Im feeling like Ive missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that its not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better know you better now
I just wanna know you know you know you

All I know is we said Hello
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And youll be mine and Ill be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said Hello
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days Ill know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Song Name: Starlight (Taylor's Version)
I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window we were seventeen and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

He said Look at you worrying too much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things

Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

Oohooh hes talking crazy
Oohooh dancing with me
Oohooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach em how to dream

Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo
Ooh hoo hoo

Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight

Like were made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight Ooh hoo hoo
Like we dream impossible dreams Ooh hoo hoo

Dont you see the starlight starlight Ooh hoo hoo
Dont you dream impossible things

Song Name: Begin Again (Taylor's Version)
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song but I do I do

I walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you but I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im coming off a little shy but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time whats past is past

Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a café I watched it begin again

Song Name: The Moment I Knew (Taylor's Version)
You shouldve been there
Shouldve burst through the door
With that Baby Im right here smile
And it wouldve felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I wouldve been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
Ive got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how Ive been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said youd be here
You said youd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
As Im looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When theres something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
He said hed be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing Missing
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didnt show

You shouldve been here
And I wouldve been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And theyre all standing around me singing
Happy birthday to you
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Ohohohohohohoh I knew
Ohohohohohohoh

You called me later
And said Im sorry I didnt make it
And I said Im sorry too
And that was the moment I knew

Song Name: Come Back...Be Here (Taylor's Version)
You said it in a simple way
4 AM the second day
How strange that I dont know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself dont get attached
But in my mind I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never wouldve played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I cant help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in London today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York be here
But youre in London and I break down
Cause its not fair that youre not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I dont wanna miss you like this
Come back be here come back be here
I guess youre in New York today
And I dont wanna need you this way
Come back be here come back be here

Ohoh ohoh
I dont wanna miss you like this
Ohoh ohoh
Come back be here
Come back be here

Song Name: Girl At Home (Taylor's Version)
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I dont even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do whats upstanding and right
Its kinda like a code yeah
And youve been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But honey I am no ones exception
This I have previously learned

So dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone and I say
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
Youre the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And yeah I might go with it
If I hadnt once been just like her

So dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now youve got me alone and I say
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that

Ohoh
Ohoh

Call a cab lose my number
Youre about to lose your girl
Call a cab lose my number
Lets consider this lesson learned

Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that ahah
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her youre coming home
Dont look at me you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadnt once been just like her

Song Name: State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor's Version)
Im walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

And I never
Saw you comin
And Ill never
Be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is dont let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And Ive loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

I never
Saw you comin
And Ill never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
Youre my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never
Saw you comin
And Ill never
Be the same oh

Oh I never
Saw you comin
And Ill never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

Song Name: Ronan (Taylor's Version)
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray well just disappear
Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
And what if I kept the handmedowns you wont grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
Come on baby with me
Were going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

Song Name: Better Man (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
I know Im probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didnt know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasnt 4AM standing in the mirror
Saying to myself You know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy oh I can hear it now
Talking down to me like Id always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh you never thought Id run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days its all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you cant say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we wouldve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah yeah

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
We might still be in love if you were a better man
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
Yeah yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man

Song Name: Nothing New (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
They tell you while youre young
Girls go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When youre soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say She looks like shes been through it
Lord what will become of me
Once Ive lost my novelty

Ive had too much to drink tonight
And I know its sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me when Im nothing new

How long will it be cute all this crying in my room
When you cant blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingénue

Ive had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me when Im nothing new

I know someday Im gonna meet her
Its a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
Shell know the way and then shell say she got the map from me
Ill say Im happy for her then Ill cry myself to sleep
Oh woah oh woah oh oh

Ive had Ive had too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if theyll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up Wake up in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me will you still want me
Will you still want me when Im nothing new

Song Name: Babe (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
What about your promises promises
What about your promises promises promises No

What a shame
Didnt wanna be the one that got away yeah
Big mistake you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

Im here on the kitchen floor
You call but I wont hear it

You really blew this babe
We aint getting through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe This is the last time this is the last time
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe
What about your promises promises promises

Takin down the pictures and the plans we made yeah
And its strange how your face doesnt look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and thats on you babe

I break down every time you call
Were a wreck youre the wrecking ball

Since you admitted it I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck I cant unsee it

What a shame didnt want to be the one that got away
How could you do this babe

You really blew this babe
We aint getting through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe This is the last time this is the last time

Song Name: Message In A Bottle (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
I know that you like me
And its kinda frightening
Standing here waiting waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But now youre so far away and Im down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
Im reaching for you terrified

Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you cant sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days Im restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

Cause now youre so far away and Im down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
Im reaching for you terrified

Cause you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you cant sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

How is it in London London
Where were you while Im wondering Wondering
If Ill ever see you again

You could be the one that I love
And now Im standing here hoping it gets to you

Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you cant sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
And now Im standing here hoping this gets to you

Song Name: I Bet You Think About Me (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
3 AM and Im still awake Ill bet youre just fine
Fast asleep in your city thats better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And Ill bet your friends tell you shes better than me huh

Well I tried to fit in with your uppercrust circles
Yeah they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talkin about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved em that I hadnt heard of

But now that were done and its over
I bet you couldnt believe
When you realized Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silverspoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm no it wasnt a mansion
Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say you cant help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in you said were too different
You laughed at my dreams rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr Superior Thinkin
Do you have all the space that you need
I dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me

Oh block it all out
The voices so loud sayin
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that youre lookin for
Is the love that you had

Now youre out in the world searchin for your soul
Scared not to be hip scared to get old
Chasing makebelieve status last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me

But now that were done and its over
I bet its hard to believe
That it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And yeah I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when youre out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your milliondollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
Oh my god shes insane she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me

Song Name: Forever Winter (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
He says Why fall in love just so you can watch it go away
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call just checking up on him
Hes up 3 AM pacing
He says Its not just a phase Im in
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out its hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death hell decide to leave instead
I call just checking up on him
Hes up 5 AM wasted
Long gone not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

If I was standing there in your apartment
Id take that bomb in your head and disarm it
Id say I love you even at your darkest and
Please dont go

I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

Ill be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM pacing
All this time I didnt know
At 5 AM wasted
Id be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
I say Believe in one thing I wont go away

Song Name: Run (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
One two three four

Give me the keys Ill bring the car back around
We shouldnt be in this town
And my socalled friends they dont know
Id drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and dont say no no
Theres a chain round your throat piece of paper where I wrote
Ill wait for you
Theres a key on the chain theres a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run like youd run from the law
Darling lets run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run

So you laugh like a child
And Ill sing like no one cares
No one to be no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and dont say no no
And the note from the locket you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
Theres a heart on your sleeve
Ill take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run like youd run from the law
Darling lets run
Run from it all
We can go like theyre trying to chase us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run

Theres been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say youll never let em tear us apart
And Ill hold onto you while we run And we run and we run and we run

Like youd run from the law And we run and we run and we run
Darling lets run And we run and we run and we run
Run from it all And we run and we run and we run
We can go where our eyes can take us And we run and we run and we run
Go where no one else is run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh well run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh well run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh well run And we run and we run and we run
Ooh and well run

Song Name: The Very First Night (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend this same party
I never go alone and I dont seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything Im going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
Cause they dont know about the night in the hotel
They werent riding in the car when we both fell
Didnt read the note on the Polaroid picture
They dont know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didnt know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo then we broke each others hearts
But dont forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away take me away
Take me away to you to you
Take me away take me away
Take me away to you to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
Im the one on the phone as you whisper
Do you know how much I miss you
I wish that we could go back in time
And Id say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night

I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away take me away
Take me away to you to you
Take me away take me away
Take me away to you to you

Song Name: All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault)
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
You taught me bout your past thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy
Key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down any time now
Hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well yeah

Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all

They say alls well that ends well but Im in a new Hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened you
Thats what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sipping coffee like youre on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
And he said Its supposed to be fun turning twentyone

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known

It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
Ill get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it

Song Name: A Message From Taylor
Musically and lyrically Red resembled a heartbroken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy free confused lonely devastated euphoric wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red
I love you guys

Song Name: Maroon
When the morning came we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
Howd we end up on the floor anyway
You say
Your roommates cheapass screw top rosé
Thats how
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my tshirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks so scarlet it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

When the silence came we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Aint that the way shit always ends
You were standing holloweyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
Thats us
I feel you no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my tshirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks so scarlet it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fuckin legacy legacy
It was maroon
And I wake with your memory over me
Thats a real fuckin legacy to leave

The burgundy on my tshirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon

Song Name: Anti-Hero
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

Its me hi Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
A tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

Its me hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

I have this dream my daughterinlaw kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from Hell

Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees

Its me hi Hi Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime Teatime everybody agrees Everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Song Name: Snow On The Beach
One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what couldve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time cant stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful thanks for asking
Im unglued thanks to you

And its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But its comin down no sound its all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And its fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till its true

Now its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But its comin down no sound its all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow oh

I cant speak afraid to jinx it
I dont even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now Im all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing can it

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight feels impossible
But its comin down no sound its all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But its comin down no sound its all around

Like snow on the beach
Its coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down
Like snow on the beach
Its coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down
Its coming down its coming down its coming down its coming down
Down its coming down its coming down its coming down

Song Name: You're On Your Own, Kid
Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
Hes gonna notice me
Its okay were the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice
Youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town
I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
Youre on your own kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long Daisy May
I picked the petals he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare
Youre on your own kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a bloodsoaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid

Youre on your own kid
Yeah you can face this
Youre on your own kid
You always have been

Song Name: Midnight Rain
Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him its every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when Im on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this

Song Name: Question...?
I remember

Good girl sad boy
Big city wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
Cause I dont remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin situations circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question

Halfmoon eyes bad surprise
Did you realize out of time
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin politics and gender roles
And youre not sure and I dont know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question

Does it feel like everythings just like second best after that meteor strike
And whats that that I heard that youre still with her
Thats nice Im sure thats whats suitable
And right
But tonight

Can I ask you a question Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room In a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you You making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question

Song Name: Vigilante Shit
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things but Im the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I dont dress for women
I dont dress for men
Lately Ive been dressing for revenge

I dont start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Lately Ive been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope where you think she got it from
Now she gets the house gets the kids gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your exwife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately shes been dressing for revenge

She dont start shit but she can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
She dont dress for friends
Lately shes been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I dont dress for villains
Or for innocents
Im on my vigilante shit again

I dont start shit but I can tell you how it ends
Dont get sad get even
So on the weekends
I dont dress for friends
Lately Ive been dressing for revenge

Song Name: Bejeweled
Baby love I think Ive been a little too kind
Didnt notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when youre in their top five
And by the way
Im going out tonight

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy I think Ive been too good of a girl
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think its time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling

Nice Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my auras moonstone
Just cause he was high
And were dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do
A diamonds gotta shine

Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
Dont put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real Nice
I polish up real nice

And were dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do
Whats a girl gonna do
I polish up nice
Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

Song Name: Labyrinth
It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in breathe through breathe deep breathe out
Ill be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It cant last

Uh oh Im falling in love
Oh no Im falling in love again
Oh Im falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
Howd you turn it right around

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up break free break through break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh oh Im falling in love
Oh no Im falling in love again
Oh Im falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
Howd you turn it right around

Uh oh Im falling in love
Oh no Im falling in love again
Oh Im falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
Howd you turn it right around

Uh oh Im falling in love falling in love
Oh no Im falling in love again falling in love again
Oh Im falling in love falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
Howd you turn it right around

Uh oh Im falling in love falling in love
Oh no Im falling in love again falling in love again
Oh Im falling in love falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
Howd you turn it right around

You know how much I hate it
You know how much I hate it
You know how much I hate it

Song Name: Karma
Youre talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal but youre relevant
Youre terrified to look down
Cause if you dare youll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
Its coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean

Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once trick me twice
Dont you know that cash aint the only price
Its coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean

Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but Im still here
Im still here Im still here

Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karmas on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karmas gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

Cause karma is my boyfriend Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend Weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god Ah
Uhhuh mm
Karmas a relaxing thought

Song Name: Sweet Nothing
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say What a mind
This happens all the time
Ooh
Ooh

Cause they said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smoothtalking hucksters
Out gladhanding each other
And the voices that implore
You should be doing more
To you I can admit
That Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

They said the end is coming They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something Everyones up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside theyre push and shoving Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

Song Name: Mastermind
Once upon a time the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate I couldnt lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
It was all by design
Cause Im a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lovers game
If you fail to plan you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
Im the wind in our freeflowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
It was all my design
Cause Im a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time Ive felt the need to confess
And I swear
Im only cryptic and Machiavellian cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk
On your face you knew the entire time
You knew that Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
Yeah all you did was smile
Cause Im a mastermind

Song Name: Hits Different
I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin on
They say that if its right you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different cause its you

Cause its you

I used to switch out these Kens Id just ghost
Rip the bandaid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never dont cry And I never dont cry at the bar
Yeah my sadness is contagious My sadness is contagious
I slur your name til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different cause its you

Cause its you

I find the artifacts cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin
You were the one that I loved
Dont need another metaphor its simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldnt kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative antithetical dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door
Is it okay Is it you
Or have they come to take me away
To take me away

Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different It hits different
It hits different cause its you

Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
Cause its you
Catastrophic blues
Movin on was always easy for me to do
It hits different Yeah
It hits different cause its you

Song Name: You're On Your Own, Kid (Strings Remix)
Summer went away still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently hes gonna notice me
Its okay were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

I see the great escape so long Daisy May
I picked the petals he loves me not
Something different bloomed writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare

Youre on your own kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a bloodsoaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid

Youre on your own kid
Yeah you can face this
Youre on your own kid
You always have been

Song Name: Meet Me At Midnight
Hey Apple Music this is Taylor Swift
Midnights tells the stories of thirteen sleepless nights scattered throughout my life
I hope you like it and wherever you are youll meet me at midnight


-----
Song Name: The Great War
My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember uhhuh
Tears on the letter I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe its the past thats talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember uhhuh
The burning embers I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uhhuh uhhuh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense Id been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought Id lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
Theres no morning glory
It was war it wasnt fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember uhhuh
Were burned for better I vowed
I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uhhuh uhhuh
I will always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uhhuh
I vowed I will always be yours

Song Name: Bigger Than The Whole Sky
No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause its all over now all out to sea

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia
Did some force take you because I didnt pray
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
Cause its all over its not meant to be
So Ill say words I dont believe

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you

What couldve been wouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you

Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you

Song Name: Paris
Your exfriends sister met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago some wannabe Zlister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos
No I didnt but thanks though

Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead
If you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind thats thrown
I mean the kind under where a tree has grown

Im so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
Stumble down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine make believe its champagne
I was taken by the view
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris oh
We were somewhere else

I want to brainwash you into loving me forever
I want to transport you to somewhere the cultures clever
Confess my truth in swooping sloping cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights
Be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No I didnt see the news
Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway
Drinking champagne
Cause we were in Paris
Yes we were somewhere else
My love we were in Paris
Yes we were somewhere else

Song Name: High Infidelity
Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes

Storm coming
Good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely
Good money
Id pay if youd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes
You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it

Oh theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And its never enough its never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count
But oh you were keeping count

Song Name: Glitch
We were supposed to be just friends
You dont live in my part of town but maybe Ill see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship Im in
And whats in my system

I think theres been a glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch ahyeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone elses playground
But its been 2190 days of our love blackout
Our love is blacking out
The systems breaking down
The systems breaking down

I think theres been a glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch ahyeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
Id go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And thats romance
Lets dance

Glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastening myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch

Song Name: Would've, Could've, Should've
If you wouldve blinked then I wouldve
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you couldve
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint did it splatter
On a promising grown man
And if I was a child did it matter
If you got to wash your hands
Oh all I used to do was pray
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If youd never looked my way

I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish youd left me wondering

If you never touched me I wouldve
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they couldve
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I couldve gone on as I was
But lord you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
Oh youre a crisis of my faith
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If Id only played it safe

I wouldve stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish youd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If claritys in death then why wont this die
Years of tearing down our banners you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood it was mine first

And I damn sure never wouldve danced with the devil
At nineteen and the gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish youd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Oh god rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Song Name: Dear Reader
Dear reader
If it feels like a trap
Youre already in one
Dear reader
Get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader
Burn all the files desert all your past lives
And if you dont recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart

Dear reader
Bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader
You dont have to answer
Just cause they asked you
Dear reader
The greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader
When you aim at the devil
Make sure you dont miss

Never take advice from someone whos falling apart
Never take advice from someone whos falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man

Spilling out to you for free
But darling darling please
You wouldnt take my word for it
If you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house not a home all alone cause nobodys there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when youre playing solitaire

You should find another guiding light
Guiding light but I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light
Guiding light but I shine so bright

You should find another
You should find another
Find another
You should find another

Song Name: ...Ready For It? (Bloodpop® Remix)
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom some
Some boys are tryin too hard he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendettata

I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night in my dreams Yeah
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams The night my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so Ill take my time
Are you ready for it

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief then he can join the heist and
Well move to an island and
And he can be my jailer Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now Im so very tame now
Never be the same now now

I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night in my dreams Night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby Wed do baby
Yeah in the middle of the night in my dreams My dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so I take my time
Are you ready for it

Night in my dreams
Wed do baby
Yeah in the middle of the night
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby

Song Name: Ain't Nothing 'Bout You
The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me

Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
Its a perfect passion and I cant get enough

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
Theres aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

Whoa

In my life Ive been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you gotta do is smile at me and down I go
And baby its no mystery why I surrender
Girl you got everything

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

I love your attitude your rose tattoo your every thought
Your smile you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me
The way you kiss the way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There aint nothing bout you there aint nothing bout you
That dont do something for me

The way you look the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance your drive you make me feel alive

The way you talk the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aint nothing bout you that dont do something for me

Song Name: All Because Of Ellen
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Outrun my gun

All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
You better run
You better run
Faster than my bullet

Ellen works a long day
Giving weird interviews in a slick cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird
Yeah calling us like were boyfriend and girlfriend

But its not cause were just sitting here
And we got cat videos and dance on Betty White and stuff
And its always gonna get weird
Cause this song is all about Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

Ive been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I couldve died

Shes always asks me who Im dating
Every time Im on this show
And I dont even know why
But it gets five million hits on YouTube

Cause every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show
Its really weird
Really weird
Always end up dancing

Song Name: All Night Diner
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what youre doin right now
Yeah I slept in my makeup again
Tell myself I must be crazy
Thinkin bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair
About that time you call me
And Im reminded without you

Id be a stranger in an allnight diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I go to work
Work all day
Im a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car dig out my keys
Start thinkin if you were with anyone but me

Im a stranger in an allnight diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

There you are
On the street
Just standing there waiting on me
I show you my new shoes
You say you love them
And baby without you

Im a stranger in an allnight diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
Thats never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what youre doin right now

Song Name: All Of The Girls You Loved Before
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin with someone
But feelin alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someones handwriting not mine
Were sneakin out into town
Holdin hands just killin time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town Ooh
Cryin in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No ones home sixteen and wild Ooh
Were breakin up makin up
Leave without sayin goodbye Ooh

And just know that
Its everything that made me
Now I call you baby
Thats why youre so amazing

All of the girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you theres good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you loved before Ooh
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street Deadend street led you straight to me Straight to me
Now youre all I need All I need Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

I love you more
I love you more

Song Name: All Too Well (Sad Girl Autumn Version)
I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But somethin bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now

Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singin in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh

Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers tellin stories bout you on the teeball team
You taught me bout your past thinkin your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys Fuck the patriarchy
Keychain on the ground we were always skippin town
And I was thinkin on the drive down Any time now
Hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancin round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well ohohohoh

And maybe we got lost in translation maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece til you tore it all up
Runnin scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein honest
Im a crumpledup piece of paper lyin here
Cause I remember it all all all

They say alls well that ends well but Im in a new hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it wouldve been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin in a party bathroom
Some actress askin me what happened you
Thats what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sippin coffee like youre on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willin you to come
And he said Its supposed to be fun turning twentyone

Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still tryin to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah

Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin jokes but the punch line goes
Ill get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it Just between us all too well
Just between us I remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it All too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there Oh
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it

Song Name: Am I Ready For Love
Sometimes I wonder how its gonna feel
Will my first love be true and real
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall
What will I do when my love comes to call
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Every day he says Darling youre my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love

I know Im not a little girl anymore
Cause Im feeling things Ive never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said Be true to yourself and keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for love

Its a run around the world
And its moving so fast
Though I wanna find
A love thats gonna last
A love so strong
That it can withstand
The weight of this world
In the palm of its hand

Will my love come in a bowl of fire
Will it be filled with hope and desire
Will my love come in a pouring rain
Am I ready for the joy am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy am I ready for this game
Am I ready for the kiss am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss am I ready for love

Song Name: American Boy
American boy living life as it goes
Sittin on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl
Trying to survive

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in this world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Living off of bar tips trying for relationships
Looking for the love
Suddenly rise an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats sent from above

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The dream of an American boy

American boy raising little babies
Hearing Daddy maybe Ill be like you
Suddenly life seems just like a new dawn
Thats grown up American boy

The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
And mama makes her cookies and daddys just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

Song Name: American Girl
Well she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldnt help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was gonna keep

Oh yeah all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Well it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach

And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God its so painful
Its something thats so close but still so far out of reach

Oh yeah all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl

Oh yeah all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah all right
Take it easy baby
Oh take it easy now

Oh yeah all right
She was an American girl

Song Name: Angelina
Angelinas got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
Ive never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I dont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Just watched Stephen run across the field
Watched him catch the ball
Hes got everything youd wanna be
Hes funny dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I wont cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Stardom pushed across the line
Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah
But aint it funny how
It all comes out
Isnt life sweet

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not perfect you could say

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
Im fine just a bit of a mess
And Im not Im not oh
And Im not perfect you could say
I wasnt brought up that way

Song Name: Anti-Hero (Remix)
Im the problem its me

I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

Its me hi
Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Always rooting for the antihero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is an art bro lately
And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of 90s guilt
Maybe Im the problem its me

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman
Taylor youll be fine
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

Its me Me hi Hi
Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime Teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Always rooting for the antihero

I have this dream my daughterinlaw kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from Hell

Im the problem its me
Taylor
Im the problem its me

Its me hi Hi
Im the problem its me Im the problem its me
At teatime Teatime everybody agrees Everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero

Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero
Always rooting for the antihero

Song Name: Baby, Don't You Break My Heart Slow
I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say
When you say our love could last forever

Well Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow

I like the way youd hold me
Every night for so long baby
I like the way youd sing to me
Every time the things got rocky yeah

I was believing in you
Was I mistaken
Do you say
Do you say what you mean
When you say our love could last forever

Well Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow

Oh yeah yeah

Youd run around
And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking were together
I want our love to last forever

But Id rather you be mean
Than love and lie
Id rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And Id rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby dont you break my heart slow
Now baby dont you break my heart
Slow

Song Name: Back To December / Apologize / You're Not Sorry
Im so glad you made time to see me
Hows life Tell me hows your family
I havent seen them in a while
Youve been good busier than ever
We small talk work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days I havent been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didnt call
Then I think about summer all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying Im sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tan skin your sweet smile
So good to me so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear Id love you right
Id go back in time and change it but I cant
So if the chain is on your door I understand

And then he said its too late to apologize
Its too late
He said its too late to apologize
Its too late

This is me swallowing my pride
Its too late to apologize
Standing in front of you
Its too late
saying Im sorry for that night
Its too late to apologize
And I go back to December 
Its too late
Its too late to apologize
It turns out freedom aint nothing but missing you
Its too late to apologize
Wishing Id realized what I had when you were mine
Its too late to apologize
Its too late

He said youre not sorry
Its too late to apologize
No no no
Its too late
Youre not sorry
Its too late to apologize
No no no
Youre not sorry
Its too late
No no no
Its too late
Youre not sorry
No no no

Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I dont know why I

I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

Youre here your eyes are looking into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before

In only a little while Ill cry
Cause youre my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause II

I wanna be everything you need

Youre here your eyes are looking into mine
So baby make me fly

Song Name: Beautiful Ghosts
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldnt know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me
So I watch from the dark wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms Ill never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

Perilous night their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms Ill never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isnt what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isnt safe but its wild and its free

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Ill never wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something something to cling to
I never knew Id love this world theyve let me into

And the memories were lost long ago
So Ill dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So Ill dance with these beautiful ghosts

Song Name: Being With My Baby
All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
And summer sings a lullaby
For me and my baby
On the hood of his daddys car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet mamas wondering where we are
Its just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what Ive found

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture with my mind
Of me and my baby
The car pulls up and Im home too late
We didnt take that interstate
That back road was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh I cant leave yet

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Cause nothings quite like being with my baby

We both know what weve found
So he turns that car around

Ooh lifes so sweet right here
Ooh keeping it young and crazy
Ooh just wanna stay right here
Ooh hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby my baby

Song Name: Bette Davis Eyes
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA did you know that
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that Im such a fan of and
Id love to play you some music that Im a fan of thats come from LA is that okay
This one came out in 1981 8 years before I was born and I love this song Its called Bette Davis Eyes

Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
Shes got Bette Davis eyes

Shell turn her music on
You wont have to think twice
Shes pure as New York snow
Shes got Bette Davis eyes

And shell tease you
Shell unease you
All the better just to please you
Shes precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
Shes got Bette Davis eyes

Shell let you take her home
It whets her appetite
Shell lay you on her throne
Shes got Bette Davis eyes

Shell expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
Shes ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush ayy ayy
All the boys think shes a spy
Shes got Bette Davis eyes

Song Name: Better Man
I know Im probably better off on my own
Than lovin a man who didnt know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasnt 4am standing in the mirror
Saying to myself you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know Im probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy oh I can hear it now
Youre talking down to me like Ill always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh you never thought Id run

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days its all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you cant say that

I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we wouldve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah yeah

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
We might still be in love if you were a better man
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You wouldve been the one
If you were a better man

Song Name: Better Off
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet there was never a doubt
That we wont forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this  our first kiss

All my friends are saying 
Girl what are you thinking
Youre better off 
youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
They can talk forever they just dont know better

We drive around town in a rusty old truck
Somehow it feels like were flying
Dont wanna come down
But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause youre gone

All my friends are saying
Girl why are you crying
Youre better off youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
They can talk forever they just dont know better

You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we dont have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We dont have to do things their way

All my friends are saying
Girl what are you thinking
Youre better off youre better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl that boy is trouble
Youre better off youre better off
Well they can talk forever they just dont know better

Song Name: Brand New World
Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly
Cause Im living in a brand new world
And you think Im just another girl
But Im living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday Im gonna fly

Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what Im proud of
Cause Im living in a brand new world
And you think Im just another girl
But Im living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday Im gonna fly

And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart
Cause Im living in a brand new world
And you think Im just another girl
But Im living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Im living in a brand new world
And you think Im just another girl
But Im living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday Im gonna fly

Song Name: Breathless
Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought youd want to know

That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you wont go again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Im so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that youve found you even
Missed yourself
Im only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh youll never go again
Again again

When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
Ill never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless

When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms

Song Name: Brought Up That Way
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddys hand
He says Baby girl whats wrong with you
She says Please dont make me go back there again

She said I wish there was some way to make them stop it
So he drives down to that principals office
And says

I didnt bring her up so they could cut her down
I didnt bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girls smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face
She wasnt brought up that way

Emilys home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh but somethings different this time
She doesnt have too much to say

She said He tried but theres just some things I wont do
And through the tears she said I couldnt do that to you
And he said

I didnt bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girls smile
So dont let nobody take that away
You werent brought up that way

The phone rings on a rainy night says Its officer Tate
He said Sir theres been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily shes fading fast

He says God I didnt bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing kept me alive was that little girls smile
So please dont take that away
It wont be easy taking her today
She wasnt brought up that way

He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes


-----
Song Name: By The Way
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room
Holding her hand
Id have never guessed
That starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
Well pick up where we left off

And by the way
Your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My hearts still breaking
Its gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

I shouldve let you know
All the ways you made me feel alive
I guess its too late
So Ill just get my coat
And make my way into this breezy night
Give you one last wave
Maybe youll drop what youre doing
And come over here to say
Im looking good

But by the way
Your eyes are dancing
Id say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way
My hearts still breaking
Its gonna take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say

By the way
You still look amazing
And I mustve been crazy to let you get away
By the way
If you ever wondered
Still got the same old number just in case
I still miss you
And I still love you
By the way
By the way oh

Song Name: Can I Go With You
Any day now theyre talking war
I can see the look thats in your eyes
Theyre not talking a week or two
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you

You pack a suitcase take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think youre gonna be
You say this crazy worlds come undone

Summers over and leaves begin to fall
And another winters on the way
I knew I wasnt gonna take this very well
But Id give anything to have you here today

Everyday now theyre talking war
And I know this time is like its never been before
Were not talking about a week or two

Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you
Oh daddy can I go with you

Song Name: Can't Stop Loving You
So youre leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everythings alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say thats the way it goes
And I could pretend and you wont know
That I was lying

Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I

We took a taxi to the station not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I dont know
Im feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway tracks
And when I hear that whistle blow
Ill walk away and you wont know
That I was crying

Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I

And Ill always be by your side
Cause I never wanted to say goodbye
And Ill always be here be here if you change change your mind

And Ill always be by your side
And I never wanted to say goodbye
And Ill always be here be here if you change change your mind

So youre leaving in the morning on the early train
And I could say everythings alright
I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

Cause I cant stop loving you
No I cant stop loving you
No I wont stop loving you
Why should I

And Ill always be by your side
And I never wanted to say goodbye
And Ill always be here be here if you change change your mind

Cause I cant stop
Ill always be here by your side
I never wanted to say goodbye
Ill always be here if you change change your mind

Why should I
Why should I even try
Ill always be here by your side
I didnt wanna say goodbye
So why should I even try

Song Name: Carolina
O Carolina creeks
Running through my veins
Lost I was born
Lonesome I came
Lonesome Ill always stay

Carolina knows
Why for years I roam
Free as these birds
Light as whispers
Carolina knows

And you didnt see me here
No they never did see me here

And shes in my dreams
Into the mist into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

Carolina stains
On the dress she left
Indelible scars
Pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled

Carolina pines
Wont you cover me
Hide me like robes
Down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didnt see me here
No they never did see me

And shes in my dreams
Into the mist into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

And you didnt see me here
They never did see me here
No you didnt see me here
They never saw me

O Carolina knows
Why for years theyve said
That I was guilty as sin
And sleep in a liars bed
But the sleep comes fast
And Ill meet no ghosts
Its between me
The sand and the sea
Carolina knows

Song Name: Check Out This View
I dont need a lot but theres one thing love has taught me
Its to never expect too much
Dont need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you

Dont need mine I found mine
Why should we be wasting time

You dont know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summers eve
No offense to them but they aint got nothing
You walk in a room
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are

And you dont know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a window looking at you
At you

You dont know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you

You dont know what you missed
I look into your eyes like this
You should be in front of me
Seeing everything I see looking at you
Check out this view

Song Name: Christmas Tree Farm
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and Im somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me I love you
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Theres a light in the barn
Wed run inside out from the cold
In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs
And theyre warm and theyre safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me I love you
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby yeah

And when Im feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
And when the world isnt fair
Ill pretend that were there
Baby baby Merry Christmas
To you

Under the mistletoe To you
Watching the fire glow
And telling me I love you

Baby baby Merry Christmas
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
Darling
Baby baby Merry Christmas
I love you

Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
I just want you to know
Oh baby baby Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

Song Name: Closest To A Cowboy
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood
Well thats good enough for me
Dont need the real thing
Thats just another thing
For me to try to tame
Dont know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded
Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads
And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset Id be a riding off with him

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me

It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But Ill never look
At a sunset the same night

Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
Thats the closest youll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Thats the closest to a cowboy
Youll see me


-----
Song Name: Crazier
Id never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
Til you open the door
Theres so much more
Id never seen it before

I was trying to fly but I couldnt find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

Ive watched from a distance
As you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real

You showed me something that I couldnt see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier

Baby you showed me what living is for
I dont wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier crazier
Feels like Im fallin and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier crazier crazier
Crazier crazier

Song Name: Cross My Heart
Ive been counting days and
Ive been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above
I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Dreaming of you baby
Ive been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
Cause Ive been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you

I dont want to jinx my luck
Ive left it all behind me
And Ive been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if youve seen one
Id like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
Ill pray for you and me and hope Im right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

Song Name: Dark Blue Tennessee
He said I got me a nice new apartment
In a city wouldnt you have hated that
Im getting by with a broken heart you left me with
He hangs up the phone and she whispers back

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

He was lying when he said he moved to LA
Hes just hiding out on the other side of town
With his head in his hands and shes just 7 miles away
Hes staring out the window and puts her picture down saying

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

She almost called him on the night that he wrote
These simple words on his goodbye note

Missing you like this is such sweet sorrow
Wont you come back to me
Ill be here today and here tomorrow
In dark blue Tennessee

In dark blue Tennessee

Song Name: Didn't They
She walks to school with her arms crossed
Its just another day
At 10 oclock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
Its scary how things change

And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried

Didnt she call you
Didnt she need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt she pray too

He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle three men walked and said
Were here to die for our God
He stood up and said Thats funny
Cause my God died for me

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried

Didnt he call you
Didnt he need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didnt he pray too

The taxis pulled up on the very day of
They rode 100 floors up just to come back down
They never thought theyd see the day
That the towers up in flames
There was nothing left to say when it all came down

And didnt they call you
Didnt they need you bad enough
Was there some reason Im not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you Where were you
And didnt they pray too

I walk to school and I wear a cross
Im counting every day


-----
Song Name: Don't Hate Me For Loving You
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
Wed never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you block me out tonight
Honey where are you
And dont hate me for loving you

He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew 
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I wanna do is say

Dont walk away now
And dont rip my heart out
Dont you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And dont hate me for loving you

I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there
Do you even care
To cross above my head
But someone said

Dont turn away now
And dont rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know its right for you
And dont hate me for loving you

I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye


-----
Song Name: Down Came The Rain
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

In through the window I see her with you
Im soaked to the skin youre warm and dry
I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling

Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we couldve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Down came the rain

Song Name: Drops Of Jupiter
Spoken You know you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world did you know that

Well now hes back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair hey hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that theres time to change hey hey
Since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June hey hey 

Tell me did you sail across the sun
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights are faded
That heaven is overrated 

Tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there 

Well now hes back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation hey hey
He checks out Mozart while he does taebo
Reminds me that theres room to grow hey hey 

Well now hes back in the atmosphere
Im afraid that he might think of me as plain ol Jane
Told a story about a man who is too afraid to fly so he never did land 

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did Venus blow your mind
Was it everything you wanted to find
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know youre wrong
Can you imagine no first dance freeze dried romance fivehour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet
Did you finally get the chance to dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way
And tell me did you fall for a shooting star
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me while you were looking for yourself

Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa oh oh ohhh
Na na na na na na na na na na na na naaa oh oh ohhh

Can you imagine no love pride deepfried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you even when I know youre wrong
Can you imagine no first dance freeze dried romance fivehour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had and me

Song Name: Eyes Open
Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even when youre sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards winning battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open

So here you are two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around turn around oh theyve surrounded you
Its a showdown showdown and nobody comes to save you now
But youve got something they dont
Yeah youve got something they dont
Youve just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open

Everybodys waiting for you to break down
Everybodys watching to see the fallout
Even when youre sleeping sleeping

Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open
Keep your eyeyes open

Song Name: Eyes Open (Taylor's Version)
Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even when youre sleeping
Keep your eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winnin battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

So here you are
Two steps ahead and stayin on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around Turn around
Oh theyve surrounded you its a showdown Showdown
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got somethin they dont
Yeah you got somethin they dont

You just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes

Keep your feet ready heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open

Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

Song Name: Fall Back On You
Isnt it funny how many times we can say
Weve drawn the line crossed it out turned the page
And moved on
Thats what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old browneyed thought
Uh oh uh oh

I wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friends
Well just drive down this road til the one were on ends
And well tell each other things like I need you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
Ill fall back on you

We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time

You wont tell nobody
I wont tell my friends
Well just drive down this road and pray it doesnt end
And well tell each other things like I love you

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Ill fall back on you

Maybe well last
Maybe we wont
Maybe well stop talking and Ill haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe you belong with me

You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby Ill fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby baby Ill fall back on you
Fall back on you ooh ooh
Fall back on you

Song Name: Firefly
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in and erased it

For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it do you
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you but I cant
Chase the wind

And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it do you
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

I like to think Id be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you dont know it do you
I wish I could keep you
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

Song Name: For You
It wouldve been nice to see you coming
But that wouldve ruined the surprise
It wouldve been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It wouldve been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

Its hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
Its nice to know youre here and youre helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
Im saying one for you

Wouldve been cool to never fall down
But then I never wouldve seen
The power isnt with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

Its hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
Its nice to know youre here and youre helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
Im saying one saying one saying one for you

It wouldve been nice to see you coming
But that wouldve ruined the surprise
It wouldve been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
Im saying one for you

Song Name: Gracie
My names Gracie
Ill be five in May
Kind of scared cause
Ive never been on a plane
My mama says that itll be alright
Cause Im going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

My names Heather
Guess were on the same flight
Dont mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
Shes finally well enough to travel
Doctor says shes in the clear
Shes been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year

Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

James T Johnson
Thats her daddys name
Hes been overseas
Itll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

Theres a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I dont wanna get there too soon
And I know theres a God because I met him
And I see it when Im looking at you
There aint no accidents in what we do

And the people that we meet
As we go through the rain
There are no accidents in what we do

Song Name: Her
Shes real pretty if youre into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
Shes spontaneous she aint afraid of anything
Shes not the jealous type
Shes the type you give a diamond ring

And I came along just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces til Ive figured out

Theres a girl that you want
Shes everything that I am not
And you cant stop thinking about her
Theres a thin little line
And its like you cross it every time
When you cant stop thinking about her

She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well Id learn football too if you wanted me to
Uh huh
Shes really good with babies shed be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh

Its getting old I wonder if youve seen
The favorite conversations killing me

Theres a girl that you want
Shes everything that I am not
And you cant stop thinking about her
Theres a thin little line
And its like you cross it every time
When you cant stop thinking about her

Dont you know I was a 40 in school

As I lay awake at night

Song Name: Hopelessly Devoted To You
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
Im not the first to know
Theres just no getting over you

You know Im just a fool whos willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby cant you see
Theres nothing else for me to do
Im hopelessly devoted to you

But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

My head is saying Fool forget him
My heart is saying Dont let go
Hold on til the end
And thats what I intend to do
Im hopelessly devoted to you

But now theres nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
Im out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

Song Name: I Heart ?
Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I keep my life in black and blue
Before you ask me if Im alright
Think about what I had to do ooh yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

Ill be fine if you just walk by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I cant believe you made me
Sit at home cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
Theres no you and I
Remember what you put me through

I had to wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

And when youre home all alone at night
Youll still wonder why
You took everything I had oh baby
I havent thought about you and I
Theres no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we wont makeup
It didnt go the way you planned
And youll know you didnt beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark yeah
Written on the back of my hand

Song Name: I Knew You Were Trouble (Music-Video Version)
I think  I think when its all over
It just comes back in flashes you know
Its like a kaleidoscope of memories
It just all comes back But he never does
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen
Its not really anything he said or anything he did
It was the feeling that came along with it
And the crazy thing is I dont know if Im ever gonna feel that way again
But I dont know if I should
I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright
But I just thought how can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you
Maybe he knew that when he saw me
I guess I just lost my balance
I think that the worst part of it all wasnt losing him
It was losing me

Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me

And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

No apologies Hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in you were right there you were right there
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble

I dont know if you know who you are until you lose who you are

Sammy Adams
Double platinum wherever she go
Shout to French Torino
Met her out in Vegas Im not in no casino
Red lips so hard to miss
Whats wrong with being promiscuous
And I can teach you bad bad things if you into it
Dont need to get intimate just yet
Slow down I know that youre thinking you and me just met
But girl I got the remedy most important the chemistry
Good girl gone bad too much for a Kennedy
So some say some say they sold their souls for a couple hits
Id rather live the life of gold with the perfect chick
Cause that one moment so breathless and youre hoping
That youll feel the same way same way
Sparks glowing off that cute face and that sharp smile oh man
I havent crushed this hard in quite awhile oh dang
And I could care less that youre famous
We gon make the perfect couple
Cause my first name Big last name Trouble

Taylor Swift
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Until you put me down oh

So shame on me now

Now Im lying on the cold hard ground
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything yeah

Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
Oh oh trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in

Song Name: I Know What I Want
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Dont try me
Dont fight me
You be you and Ill be me

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Your mom and daddys walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didnt look again into
So sorry dont worry
Im sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Oh baby dont persuade me
I know that you aint used to no
So let me say it real slow

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

They say Ive always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you its true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it aint you

Song Name: I Used To Fly
I I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been
Cause Id seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

You you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry
Please dont leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

Oh let me think Im strong
Please dont bring me down
I need you tonight

I know you cant see me here
But I am not alone
Im lying here in invisible arms
And I wont be alone tonight

I I used to fly
Didnt matter where Id been
Cause Id seen the sky

Song Name: I Wished On A Plane
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When youre standing on a mountain
Its kind of hard to aim

Like the tree we carved our names in
There must be an explanation
Guess it didnt get enough rain
I need reasons why youre leaving

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written on your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed youd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it aint your territory
We had the perfect love story
Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you oh

Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written in your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

The night was so cloudy
Its not my fault
I just couldnt see

And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasnt written in your heart
Couldve sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

Throwing pennies at the fountain
When youre standing on a mountain
Its kind of hard to aim

Song Name: I'd Lie
I dont think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me
He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

Hell never fall in love he swears
As he runs his fingers through his hair
Im laughing cause I hope hes wrong

And I dont think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke I fake a smile
But I know all his favorite songs

And I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue born on the seventeenth
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
Id lie

He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth
Shouldnt a light go on
Doesnt he know that Ive had him memorized for so long

He sees everything in black and white
Never let nobody see him cry
I dont let nobody see me wishing he was mine

I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue born on the seventeenth
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
Id lie

He stands there then walks away
My God if I could only say
Im holding every breath for you

Hed never tell you but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart
First thought when I wake up
Is My God hes beautiful
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle

Yes I could tell you his favorite colors green
He loves to argue oh and it kills me
His sisters beautiful he has his fathers eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
Id lie

Song Name: If This Was A Movie (Taylor's Version)
Last night I heard my own heart beatin
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and Im still reachin
Even though I know youre not there
I was playin back a thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything weve been through
Maybe Ive been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin
Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now Im pacing down the hall chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothings gonna change not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

If youre out there if youre somewhere if youre moving on
Ive been waiting for you every day since youve been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

And I say Come back come back come back to me like
You would before you said its not that easy
Before the fight before I locked you out
But I take it all back now

Come back come back come back to me like
You would you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside til I came out
Come back come back come back to me like
You could you could if you just said youre sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie youd be here by now

Youd be here by now
Its not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby what about the ending
Oh I thought that youd be here by now
Oh oh
Thought youd be here by now

Song Name: In The Pouring Rain
I loved you for a little a little while
I think you know that
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you
Its not like you to be here
When you said you wont

But in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
Its not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain
It kills me to say this
It really does it kills my heart
But I might still love you
Reason were just fallen apart
But its not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind

But in the pouring rain you changed everything
You changed the tune
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules
And its not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

Oh am I
All I torn myself I would be losing
But in the pouring rain can you feel my pain
My tears are falling down from the sky
In the pouring rain I can feel
I wonder who you love tonight
Oh in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed my mind

Song Name: Just South Of Knowing Why
She didnt have a reason to go oh no
She didnt have a reason to stay
Either way she didnt tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run

And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I didnt really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch because she just felt too much
If you dont know what you want nothings ever enough

And time stands still when youre nowhere bound
Thats where Im headed right now

If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by just south of knowing why

I dont have a plan I dont have a map
I dont even know if Im ever going back
I dont have a when and I dont have a where
I dont even know if Ill know when Im there

But if I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs
I just drive on by

I just drive on by drive on drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on drive on drive on
Drive all night just south of knowing why

Song Name: Let's Go (Battle)
The first shots fired everybodys gathered around
Youre looking at me like I tried to take you down
No no thats not what happened at all
Theres no sound Im waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no no its not how I wanted this to go down

Now were standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now were fighting dirty
Wont somebody come say break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And why youre taking shots at me like
Somebodys gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby lets go oh oh
Lets go oh oh

So gloves off if this is how you want it
We had it all but you couldnt keep a promise
No no Im not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why were not fine
Is she here Is she standing on the sidelines
Oh oh cant you tell this is breaking my heart

Now were standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now Im fighting dirty
But I aint going down til they break it up

And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And why youre taking shots at me like
Somebodys gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Lets go oh oh
Lets go oh oh

Now were standing in the ring
Breaking everything
That weve been building up so long
And I dont wanna do this break it up

But youre not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like were going to war

And I used to be on your side
Now its looking like were going to battle
And Im trying not to break down crying
No ones gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But Im tired of taking all these blows
And so Id rather be on your side
Id rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby lets go oh oh
Looks like were going to war
Oh oh

The first shots fired everybodys gathered around
Youre looking at me like I tried to take you down
No no but if you wanna fight baby lets go

Song Name: Live For The Little Things
One daybreak one heartache
Every onceuponatime
That black dress happiness
Bubble baths and quarter lines

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands new romance
Living for that love and person

They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh yeah
Ohh

No fighting black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

Na na na
Oh yeah
Na na na
Ohh yeah
Na na na

Song Name: Long Time Coming
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing itd be a long time going

They say its better to have lost than never to have loved at all
And I say whoever said that didnt have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasnt how it was supposed to be with me and you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

Ive burned my bridges had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And Im still not over you

And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

A long time going

And it will be a long time long time going
Ohoh ohoh oh

It will be a long time long time going going
Ohoh ohoh oh

Song Name: Look At You Like That
There you are
Standing there looking like you dont know what to say
But I know that face
And here I am
Bracing myself for what I know is coming my way
What a waste

For all of that time I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself
Letting it go and loving you so
Dont you dare tell me not to look at you like that

Im gonna look at you like that
Im gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If its the last thing that I do
Im gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Dont you say
That we can still be friends it doesnt work that way
The end is the end
And dont you dare think
That Ill pack up all my tears and take them home
And cry them out when Im alone

Ill do it right here Im crying right now
You come and you can watch me crumble down
Thats for breaking my heart so baby dont start
Thinking you can ask me not to look at you like that

Im gonna look at you like that
Im gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If its the last thing that I do
Im gonna make this hard on you
While I look at you like that

Dont you tell me to be strong
Or make it harder than it has to be
After you are gone
Youll remember what youve done to me

Cause Im gonna look at you like that
Gonna hang my head and turn my back
To your sneak attack
If its the last thing that I do
After what you put me through
Im gonna have to let you know
How much it hurts to let you go

Oh yeah
Gonna look at you like that
Look at you look at you look at you
Like that

Song Name: Look What You Made Me Do
I dont like your little games
Dont like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool no I dont like you
I dont like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isnt cool no I dont like you Oh

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I dont like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast What
The world moves on another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on but one things for sure
Maybe I got mine but youll all get yours

But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh

Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams

Ooh look what you made me do

Song Name: Love Story (Taylor's Version) (Elvira Remix)
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
Im standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights see the party the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say Hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet cause were dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while oh oh

Cause you were Romeo I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said Stay away from Juliet
But you were everything to me
I was begging you Please dont go
And I said

Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
Ill be waiting all theres left to do is run
Youll be the prince and Ill be the princess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Romeo save me theyre trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult but its real
Dont be afraid well make it out of this mess
Its a love story baby just say Yes
Oh oh

But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said Romeo save me Ive been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head I dont know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said
Marry me Juliet youll never have to be alone
I love you and thats all I really know
I talked to your dad go pick out a white dress
Its a love story baby just say Yes

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Cause we were both young when I first saw you


-----
Song Name: Love They Haven't Thought Of Yet
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe Im wrong but I dont think Romeo would be my kind of guy
I want a love thats sweeter than roses
And for me this is how its gonna be

Like theres a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet

Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
Ill wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
Its what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I dont regret it cause it needs to be perfect

Like theres a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet

I want my own little storybook ending
Well make it up as we go

Theres a fairytale sky
And it whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they havent thought of yet

I want love they havent thought of yet


-----
Song Name: Love To Lose
Come on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience I didnt mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but its too bad you didnt see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

Lets talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside
He smiled and I smiled well the cameras in your mind
And I lied I swore that everything was fine

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called
There was something wrong it was all my fault
I had it all what a shame what a fall now
But in case you havent heard the news
There wasnt much love to lose

Come on gather round Im gonna tell you how the fire went out

Song Name: Lover (First Dance Remix)
We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Ah take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now honey but I want em all

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my lover

Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
Darling youre my my my my lover

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close

We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
Ill sing love songs to you when were eighty
See I finally got you now honey I wont let you fall

Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my lover

Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
Id go down with the Titanic its true for you lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover Save you a seat

Can I go where you go Can I go where you go baby
Can we always be this close forever and ever
And ah take me out and take me home Forever and ever
Youre my my my my

Song Name: Lucky You
Theres a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever Never say never
You can do better thats what she says

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket She dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says Do do do
Lucky you lucky you

She sings her little song She walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travels lives they unravel
Mind over matter thats what she says

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket She dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says Do do do
Lucky you lucky you lucky you

Maybe shell sing you Do do do do
Maybe shell bring you up to the skies
Honey shell love you Funny how some view
Angels above you aint so far away

Her mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket She dances in spite
Of the fact that shes different
And yet shes the same
And she says Do do do
Lucky you lucky you

Song Name: Macavity
Macavitys a mystery cat hes called the Hiddenpaw
For hes the master criminal who can defy the law
Hes the bafflement of Scotland Yard the Flying Squads despair
For when they reach the scene of crime Macavitys not there

Macavity Macavity theres no one like Macavity
Hes broken every human law he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime Macavitys not there

Macavitys a ginger cat hes very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side with movements like a snake
And when you think hes half asleep hes always wide awake

Macavity Macavity theres no one like Macavity
For hes a fiend in feline shape a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a bystreet you may see him in the square
But when a crimes discovered then Macavitys not there

Hes outwardly respectable I know he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yards
And when the larders looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another pekes been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
Theres the wonder of the thing Macavitys not there

Macavity Macavity theres no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place Macavity wasnt there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie Rumpleteazer Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations the Napoleon of Crime
Macavity Macavity theres no one like Macavity
Hes a fiend in feline shape a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a bystreet you may see him in the square
But when a crimes discovered then Macavity Macavity
Macavity Macavity

When a crimes discovered then
Macavitys not there

Song Name: Made Up You
Your feet under the table
I love it when theyre touching mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

You smile just like a picture
It doesnt even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what Ive got

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Id never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never couldve dreamed you up this good

Oh oh

Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Made Up You

Oh oh

Made Up You

Song Name: Making Up For Lost Love
I need you more than I know how to mention
And Id give forever to get your attention
Be youre summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night
Ooh ooh loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh ooh loves like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

All of the days that I couldnt get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life
Ooh ooh loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh ooh loves like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby Ive got mine
To give you everything you dream about
Ooh ooh loves like this
Its something I missed
Ooh ooh loves like this

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
Were falling now
And theres nothing we aint too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

Song Name: Mandolin
Hes got a nice little life
Hes gonna live it but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red and he said
Its not the best I know
But its mine Im gonna make it mine

People there cant help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Whos getting by from their applause
Hes got a song that moves along
Hes got his local crowd tonight
At Angelinas family bar and grill

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
Oh yeah mandolin

Got a car got a scar
Like everyone hes got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars yeah

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin mandolin
Oh yeah mandolin

Oh hes the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

Hes got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays just living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Whos that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh Im the guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh mandolin

Song Name: Matches
I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time

I patched your dance smile
That your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her

But lifes too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down

I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what youve found
Shes been around
I hear the lines long

And dont you tell me
To be nice
Im not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
Im gonna burn it down

Aint it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck
Well i say cheater liar truck on fire loser leaver deceiver
Just a few Ive thought of

And when love hands me matches now
Gonna burn it down
Im gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it burn it burn it down

Matches now

Song Name: Me And Britney
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

Oh oh
We were babies we were beautiful and free
Oh oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasnt been the same since
That boy she went ran off with well I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that hed come between me and Britney

Oh oh
She was in love she was beautiful and free
Oh oh
She was always so much braver than me

When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said Im sorry for waking you up but I didnt know who else to call
Or where else to go

Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

Oh oh
Were not as young but were still beautiful and free
Oh oh
Even when were old were still gonna be

Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else was ever gonna hear in the summer shade

Song Name: Monologue Song (La La La)
I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But Im not gonna talk about that
In my monologue
I like baking and things that smell like winter
But Im not gonna talk about that
In my monologue

La la la la la la

I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me
But Im not gonna say that
In my monologue
I like writing their names into songs so theyre ashamed to go in public
But Im not gonna say that
In my monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might think Id bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone
But Im not gonna mention him
In my monologue
Hey Joe Im doing real well
Tonight Im hosting SNL
But Im not gonna brag about that
In my monologue

La la la ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
La la la

And if youre wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
Hi Taylor
Im not gonna comment on that
In my monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But theres nothing more to say
Cause everythings okay
Ive got security lining this stage
This is my SNL monologue

La la la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la la la la la la
That was my SNL monologue

Song Name: My Cure
I know weve got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But Id be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you

If you leave Ill be crawling back for more
If you need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby youd be my cure

Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know were miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
Ill be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you

And if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love Ill be standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake Id be making

Because if you ever leave Ill be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love Im standing at your door
Ill be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know weve got a lot to say between now and forever


-----
Song Name: My Turn To Be Me
Something about me didnt fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I havent read it a thousand times

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
Shell still sing the same old songs

Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

Turned on that radio
Hey thats when I realized
It wasnt our song it was yours
And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

To talk walk think stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time Im flying free
Its my turn to be me

Its my turn to be me

Song Name: Nashville
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well its not quite London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian island
Or a second chance

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowin through a valley
Watching all my life go by

Youre a distant memory
Youre an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I cant confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowing through a mountain
Watching all my life go by

Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July

And its safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star for you
Change a southern night for you

Going back to Nashville
Thinking bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe Im a fast train
Blowing though a valley
Tearing up a good July

Im going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
Whats the use of wondering why
Maybe Im a storm front
Blowing through the valley
Tearing up a good July

Going back to Nashville

Im going back to Nashville

Going back to Naaaaahh

Going back to Nashville
Whats the use of wondering why

Song Name: Need
Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me can you come around

Passion is a passing thing
Its accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar a shortlived fire
It aint what you and I are at all

Oh its a need its a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless breathless burning slow
Touch me hold me tell me I wont let you go
I wont leave its a need

Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had you were with someone else
You forgot about me

Passion is a passing thing
Its accidental chemistry
Caught up in a feeling it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me

Oh its a need its a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless breathless burning slow
Touch me hold me tell me I wont let you go
I wont leave its a need

Baby its always
A new kiss every time we do this
The truth is
Its essential to me
That you love me more than
Wishing longing

Oh its a need Its a need its a need Ahah ahah
I would go I would go anywhere Anywhere that you lead Oh oh
I am hopeless breathless burning slow Burning slow
Touch me hold me tell me I wont let you go
I wont leave I wont leave its a need Oh

Song Name: Need You Now
I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

I need you now
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

My worlds a little colder now
But Im keeping warm somehow

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Words I heard you whisper to me
While we were walking down a oneway street

You need me now
Thats what youve been telling my friends
But Ive come too far to go back there again

My heart my mind and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
Whos gonna hold you
I dont need you dont need you now

I need you now
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I dont need you dont need you
And I waited so frustrated
So whos gonna hold you
I dont need you now
And I dont know where you are
I dont wonder where you are
I dont dream about you cause I dont need you now

I dont dream about the way
That I never heard you say
I need you I need you
I dont need you now

Dont need you
Dont need you now

Song Name: Never Fade
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didnt see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think youre all alone in this place
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade

Hard to breathe nobody knows its you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask now thats broken too
Everybody else was everything to you

The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think everybody wants a fight
I think youre crazy cause I still love you baby

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Never fade

I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know its true
Youve seen the world now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

Oh dont fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Dont count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Dont fade away
Never fade

Song Name: Nevermind
Look at you
Look at me
Look at who we could be
I wanna know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I dont
Say it but I wont
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But Im too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby never mind

All the time
Everyday
Theres nothing I can do baby to make it go away
So look at you
And look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me I could go crazy but I dont
Say it but I wont
Cause Id rather be alone than lose you

And all I really wanna do is be next to you
But Im too tired to fight
And I could tell you now
But baby never mind

All I really wanna say is I need you babe
But how could you understand
What happens if you turn away and everything turns blue and grey
And I just wish I told you never mind
And I could tell you now but baby never mind
Yeah oh yeah
I could tell you now but never mind
Yeah oh yeah yeah
And I could tell you now but never mind

Song Name: New Romantics (Music-Video Version)
The fans are the best part of this tour
They are the reason the shows are incredible
And I know those fans out there are just all in

Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better

Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace

We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
Its so romantic

I dont wanna forget anything that happened on this tour
It was one of those remarkable moments in time when everything felt exciting
1989

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby were the new romantics
Come on come along with me
Heart break is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free

Looking out into like an endless ocean of crowd
That was everything
Were all really sad that its ending
But were really happy because of what it was

Song Name: One Thing
It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin
Im driving away and I I guess you could say
This is the last time Ill drive this way again
And theres nothing to say and I try to grab at the fray
Cause I I still love you but I cant

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah

The picture frame is empty
Its black and white youre smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
I was so sure of everything everything I thought wed always have
Im lost in the sound of it
But here in the now comes in
Seems like Im becoming part of your past

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

And theres so much that I cant touch
Youre all I want but its not enough this time
And I can feel you like youre slipping through my hands
And Im so scared of how this ends

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me

Bye bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye bye baby
I want you back but its coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me yeah yeah
There was one thing I knew would never leave me

It wasnt just like a movie
The rain didnt soak through my clothes down to my skin

Song Name: One Way Ticket
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
Theres a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
Im heading out tonight traveling light
Im gonna start all over again

And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
I wont let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind

And buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that Im strong enough to let you go
And I will fall in love again
Because I can

Well I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me and now I can see my way out

Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
See how far I can go
Cause Im gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I dont know

Buy a oneway ticket on a west bound train
Im gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain gonna do everything

Song Name: Only The Young
It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
Youre screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered  this time

But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run so run
And run and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound
Youve only heard on TV
You go to class scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh how quickly they forget

They arent gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They arent gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that its over
But its just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Only the young

Only the young Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time
Up theres the finish line
Only the young Only the young
Only the young Only the young
Only the young
Can run

Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time Can run
Up theres the finish line
So run and run and run
Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time So run
Up theres the finish line
And run and run and run

Only the young
Only the young
Only the young

Song Name: Our Last Night
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was fallin
You were holdin my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I coulda spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

Wasnt it you that told me
The sun would always chase the day
Wasnt it you that told me

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimmin out on the lake
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made On our last night

Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doin nothin
You meant more to me then than you ever knew
You were gonna be a doctor a movie star poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you

Wasnt it you that told me
The sun would always chase the day
Wasnt it you that told me

Angels fly in the air tonight
Saying wasnt it just like swimmin out on the lake
And stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises you made on our last night

Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away
Like Harold and Martin singing

I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made
On our last night
On our last night
Oh oh oh whoa whoa yeah oh

Song Name: Perfect Have I Loved
If you love me then I love you swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old but if I cant at least youll know
That baby perfect have I loved

Do you remember the stupid things we used to do
Before September stole me away from you
The time we got your truck stuck in the creek
Cause baby roads werent wild enough for you and me sayin

If you love me then I love you swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old but if I cant at least youll know
That baby perfect have I loved

I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
Its hard to douse a fire that I still havent put out yet

And if you love me then I love you swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old but if I cant at least youll know
That baby perfect have I loved

Love was all we knew and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had and for one summer you were mine
Sayin

If you love me then I love you swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
Id like to keep you til Im old but if I cant at least Ill know
That baby perfect have I loved

Song Name: Permanent Marker
I know he loved you
A long time ago
I aint jealous of you
Just thought you should know

You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back
Cause I aint trying to show maturity

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
You sure had a good time
Cleaning up that mess

He found 30 other pieces
But hell never find them all
Tried to tape it back together
Now he knows to keep it off the wall

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart

X is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker
Oh yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in
Permanent marker

In permanent marker

Oh permanent marker

Song Name: Point Of View
Time is passing slowly for the eightyearold next door
But mamas watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that theyre a perfect pair
The girls could say hes just a bit too tall

You dont have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side aint far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesnt stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
Its all in your point of view

He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Babys got an attitude and thinks they just dont know
But they all do and wish that she could see

You dont have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side aint far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesnt stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
Its all in your point of view

In the least a masterpiece
Depends on ones opinion
Worst of all they never call
But dont think that they werent wishing

Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side aint far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesnt stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
Its all in your point of view
Its all in your point of view
Point of view
Its all in your point of view

Song Name: Riptide
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh all my friends are turning green
Youre the magicians assistant in their dreams

Oh and they come unstuck

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Theres this movie that I think youll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboys running from himself
And shes been living on the highest shelf

Oh and they come unstuck

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

I just wanna I just wanna know
If youre gonna if youre gonna stay
I just gotta I just gotta know
I cant have it I cant have it any other way
I swear shes destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that youve ever seen oh

Lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when youre singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
Youre gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because youre gonna sing the words wrong

Song Name: Ronan
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back

I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up

I can still feel you hold my hand little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming Why
Flowers pile up in the worst way no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And its about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room in this hospital grey well just disappear
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

What if Im standing in your closet trying to talk to you
What if I kept the handmedowns you wont grow into
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you

Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
Come on baby with me were gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

Song Name: Run
Theres a plane or a bus leaving Dallas
I hope youre on it
If theres a train moving fast down the tracks
I hope you caught it
Cause I swear out there aint where
You outta be
So catch a ride or catch a cab
Dont you know that I miss you bad
But dont you walk to me

Baby run cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You cant get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run
So baby run

Oh if you aint got a suitcase
Get a box
Or an old brown paper sack
Pack it light or pack it heavy
Take a truck take a Chevy
Baby just come back
Theres a shortcut to the highway out of town
Why dont you take it
Dont let that speed limit slow you down
Go on and break it
Baby break it

Baby run
Cut a path across the blue sky
Straight in a straight line
You cant get here fast enough
Find a truck and fire it up
Lean on the gas and off the clutch
Leave Dallas in the dust
I need you in a rush
So baby run

Run to me
Baby run
Run to me
So baby run
Run
Oh baby run

Song Name: Safe & Sound
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Dont you dare look out your window darling
Everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the musics gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
La la la la
La la la la
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
La la la la

Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound

Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh

Song Name: Same Girl
Im still wearing my blue jeans
No I dont know what you mean
Im still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
Ive always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
Ive always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
Ive always been the same girl

Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
Im just living life and thinking

Ive always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

Living in the crazy world
Ive always been the same girl

Song Name: September
Do you remember
The 28th night of September
Love was changin the minds of pretenders
While chasin the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin
In the key that our souls were singin
As we danced in the night remember
How the stars stole the night away

II say that you remember
Ai ai dancin in September
Ai ai never was a cloudy day

My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love remember
How we knew love was here to stay
Now December
Found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love remember
The love that we share today

II say that you remember
Ai ai dancin in September
Ai ai never was a cloudy day
II say that you remember
Ai ai dancin in September
Ai ai golden dreams were shiny days

Do you remember
The 28th night of September

II say that you remember
Ai ai dancin in September
Ai ai never was a cloudy day
II say that you remember
Ai ai dancin in September
Ai ai golden dreams were shiny days
And there never was a cloudy day
There never was a cloudy day

Song Name: Smokey Black Nights
Lets watch
The tide chase
The waves
Onto the sand
I wonder
If a broken heart
Can feel the warmth
On my hand
And I wonder
What a piece
Of driftwood
Has seen all through
His lifetime
Lets walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

Ive seen
A million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want
To speak to you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Still through
The haze
I can make out
Constellations
Ill make one
Of you and me
As we sit
In the sand
And I saw
That sunset gleaming
As my eyes went wild
Lets walk away
The past through
The smokey black nights

Ive played
A thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want
To sing to you

Waited on a wire
Starin at the fire
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

Ive walked
A thousand miles
Smiled
A thousand smiles
Now I only smile
When Im with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
Theres nothing
Id rather do
On the
Smokey black nights

So walk with me
As the sweet
Wind dances
Ill write a song
For you and me
On the
Smokey black nights

Song Name: Spinning Around
Days go by I wonder if you hear me
Cant you read between the lines
Now Im standing still I am disappearing
Take this chance Ill make you mine

Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

He tells lies are you really thinking
That you deserve another try
When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Dont ask how but fate decides

Dont you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl youve got to make it

But loves got me cornered in the back of the room
Im spinning around Im spinning around
And all I see is someone I dont know
Loves got me tangled tired me too
No sign of a wall sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Spinning me around
And all I see is you

Song Name: Stupid Boy
Let me know hows it feel
To be under my skin wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere youve been
And everything I do I do it just for you
So why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

I have been looking in trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt every single time
And then you walk right by Im screaming out inside
Why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

What happens when you wake up to see that youve lost
You take one look at me cause thats what it cost
I just wanna be everything you need
Cause youre everything to me

So why the hell dont you love me
Why the hell dont you need me like I need you
Why you so far above me
Dont you know that theres nothing I wouldnt do
But I was just a toy which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Let me know hows it feel to be under my skin

Song Name: Sugar
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love what a perfect home
Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world hes living on

But whenever hes gone and when shes all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says Sugar how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh shes the best thing hell ever find

With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
Shes a southern belle hes a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh she knows shes found
Such a perfect life such a perfect thing

And whenever hes gone and when shes all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

And he says Sugar how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh shes the best thing hell ever find

Oh theres a reason for every season
Theres a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

And he says Sugar how I love you
How I think about you all the time
He calls her Sugar cause shes the sweetest thing
Oh shes the best thing hell ever find

He calls her Sugar

Song Name: Sweet Escape
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause Ive been acting like sour milk all on the floor
Its your fault you didnt shut the refrigerator
Maybe thats the reason Ive been acting so cold

If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape sweet escape

You let me drown
Im at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on lets bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Lets look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
Ive been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that youre angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully you dont leave me
Wanna take you with me

If I could escape
And recreate a place thats my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry but I know Ive been a real bad girl
I didnt mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldnt that be sweet
Sweet escape sweet escape

Song Name: Sweet Tea And God's Graces
Tire swings summer dreams honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek
Laying in the green grass I was watching clouds pass
Baby you were watching me
Cold barns truck beds everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Autumn rain window pane looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us
Still got your laugh your ghost your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much
But Im a little smarter my hearts a little harder
But its still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times

I remember

You can get high on a first kiss
You can get by with sweet tea and Gods graces
You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and come back someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
Hey how have you been
You caught me with that old smile
Said Its really been a while
And I still think about back when

We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus
And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothings shatterproof
You can crash and burn and now Im someone new
And thats what I learned from you

Oh thats what I learned from you
Thats what I learned from you oh you oh
Thats what I learned from you oh yeah

Song Name: Sweeter Than Fiction
Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you hear is No
You never saw it comin
Slipped when you started runnin
And now youve come undone and I I I I

Seen you fall seen you crawl on your knees eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin
You hit the ground runnin
And now youre onto something I I I say

What a sight what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There youll stand next to me
All at once the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction than fiction

Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
Ill be one of the many saying
You made us proud you made us proud proud
Ill be one of the many saying
Look at you now look at you now now
Ill be one of the many saying
You made us proud you made us proud proud

And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that Ill be there time and again
Cause I loved you when when you

Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you heard was No
Now in this perfect weather
Its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever forever

There youll stand ten feet tall ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance your eyes
This life is sweeter than fiction

There youll stand next to me next to me
All at once the rest is history ooooh
Your eyes are wider than distance your eyes
This life is sweeter than fiction than fiction

Its sweeter than fiction

Song Name: Tell Me
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
Its like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They werent true
Its like it wasnt you

But you ran away

Song Name: Ten Dollars And A Six Pack
You were what I wanted when I wanted what I just couldnt have
You were country lovin
Really somethin for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But baby I was betting on you

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess Im gonna have to listen to my mamas I told you so
But you aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

I said Let them say were crazy you said Lets go fishing tonight
The midnight moon was blazing baby I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess Im gonna have to listen to my mamas I told you so
But you aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

Cant believe the time you lost me
Cant believe what it cost me

I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mamas I told you so
You aint never been through that
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack
You aint worth all that ten dollars and a six pack

Song Name: Tennessee
Standing on a street somewhere I dont wanna be
In a town thats made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
Cause this sure aint what I call home

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here and

Let my hair hang down and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont I just sit under this tree
And Im in Tennessee

Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on well all go fishing in the pond
But all well catch is just a summer breeze

Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here and

Let my hair hang down and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont I just sit under this tree
And Im in Tennessee

When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back back to where I feel so free
Well it looks like Im going back to Tennessee

I let my hair hang down and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by
And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I dont I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And Im in Tennessee

Song Name: That's Life
Like one of those fireflies
Oh it looks so good til its in your hand
Its like one of those memories
Where you cant let go but you just cant stand
Its like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying Whyd I love
All it does is break your heart

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie live or die
I well I guess thats life

Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
Its like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying Why did love have to hurt
It broke my heart

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie live or die
I well I guess thats life

I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push and shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

One morning does it all add up
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy
Youre getting close to giving up
In a big old way knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie live or die
I well I guess thats life
Oh I guess thats life
Well I guess thats life

Kinda girl
Hey yeah whats the word on you
Lay low Im a mission rebel
Angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

Drifting through the ocean

Song Name: There's Your Trouble
Should have been different but
It wasnt different was it
Same old story dear John
And so long
Should have fit like a glove
Should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt

Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble

So now youre thinking bout
All youre missing how
Deep youre sinking
Round and round and dragging down
Why dont you cash in your chips
Why dont you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up better luck
Could have been true love
But it wasnt
It should all add up
But it doesnt

Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble

Should have all worked out
But it didnt
She should be here now
But she isnt

Theres your trouble
Theres your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one
You cant see I love you
You cant see she doesnt
But you just keep holding on
Theres your trouble

Song Name: Thirteen Blocks (Can't Call It Love)
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that dont offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if theyre half as stubborn as me
Theyll just keep on shining bright
I aint ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling aint strong
Ill just move on
And leave this in my past

Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin bout how Ill feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
Im gonna miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Red light turns to green
Then back to red again
I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still dont know
Oh and it troubles me so oh

Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin bout how Ill feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Once youre gone I know your memoryll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wondering love how Ill feel today
I see you found somebody new
So Ive been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Cant call it love if you aint in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile

Song Name: This Here Guitar
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you can I teach you
All I know can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend
This here guitar

It was my baby anyone could see
I love the cracks the curves the hidden beauty
But I cant help wondering why
It came to me and where well say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Cant see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar

Nice to meet you can I teach you
All I know can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend
This here guitar

Were you a present from a father to a son
Did he forget you
Or just play you til you came undone
Hey did some prima donna love you
Til she got her fame and fortune
I wont do that to you

Nice to meet you can I teach you
All I know can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someones best friend
This here guitar
Youre my guitar
This here guitar

Song Name: This Is Really Happening
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and were both not making a sound
Its like Im melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

Could this be better
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still cant take my eyes off you

Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh baby here we are

Tell me
Youll never leave me
And Im not crazy and
Oh this is really happening
Oh oh baby

Tell me
Youll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh that this is really happening

Tell me oh
Youll always need me
Need me tell me
Baby
That I drive you crazy
Oh
That this is really happening

Song Name: This Love (Taylor's Version)
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone gone and gone

In silent screams in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
Oh oh

Tossing turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby I could go on and on on and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone gone gone

In losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh

This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love

Your kiss my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile my ghost
I fell to my knees
When youre young you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
This love This love left a permanent mark
This love This love is glowing in the dark oh
This love These hands had to let it go free and
This love This love came back to me oh

This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love oh
This love this love this love this love
This love This love came back to me oh

Song Name: Til Brad Pitt Comes Along
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me
And I threw the remote at you
And you said My point exactly
And later on that night under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me

It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you

And Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

You call me lucky cause I lose everything
But I swear Id be careful with it
If you gave me a ring

And it would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
And Im mad at all the lovebirds
Cause they dont play our song
I wish that pretty girls wouldnt see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
Cause thats where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along
Til Brad Pitt comes along
Yeah oh oh
Until Brad Pitt comes along

Song Name: Today Was A Fairytale
Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey Tshirt
You told me I was pretty
When I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
Youve got a smile that takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now its getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever youre around
I can feel my heart
Its beating in my chest
Did you feel it
I cant put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale

Song Name: Under My Head
Are you trying to make me fall
Cause with a face like that baby
It wont take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while Ill be hypnotized
Sitting here singing

Ooh ooh I love you I love you
Ooh ooh come a little closer
Oh oh I love you I love you
And Im down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up 
I was all caught up
Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me 
See the train is coming for me
Help me save me from this crash at last

Ooh ooh I love you I love you
Ooh ooh come a little closer
Oh oh I love you I love you
And Im down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Na na na na na na na na na 
You seem to be just what Ive tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh ooh I love you I love you
Ooh ooh I really really want you
Oh oh I love you I love you
Oh oh 

Ooh ooh I love you I love you
Ooh ooh come a little closer
Oh oh I love you I love you
And Im down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head

Song Name: Viva La Vida
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemys eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
Now the old king is dead Long live the king

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldnt believe what Id become

Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king

I hear Jerusalem bells aringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I cant explain
I know Saint Peter wont call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Song Name: Wait For Me
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasnt scared of the world alone
If I didnt know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
Youd be with me so baby

Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Its so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go cause he dont know
But the writings on the wall

But here we are in so deep
Soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I dont know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall so baby

Dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me

As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait wait for me

We cant be together right now
Guess theres no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that Im dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

So dont you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me

Dont you look now
Dont you look now
I might fall in love
Dont you look now

Song Name: We Were Happy
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
Thats sorta how I feel right now
And goodbyes so much harder
Cause we were happy

When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

Oh I hate those voices
Telling me Im not in love anymore
But they dont give me choices
And thats what these tears are for
Cause we were happy

We were happy

When it was good baby
It was good baby
We showed um all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark
Talking bout your daddys farm
And you were gonna marry me
When we were happy

Yeah we were were happy
Ohoh ohohoh
We were happy

Song Name: Welcome Distraction
I got a little thing I call self control
Cause I get a little crazy
When I let too much go
Loves a little messy and you are too
Right now Im scared of both of you
I laugh and I play and I wasnt gonna stray
Swore Id never let a man in my way

Youre the last thing I needed today

And I dont know
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction welcome distraction

Gone and spilled my coffee
Tryna get to the phone
Cause it might be you
You just never know
Cant talk to my friends
Without you coming up
Its even kind of cute
The way you cuss
I wrote your name down
A hundred thousand times
Cause it looks so good
Right next to mine

Youre the last thing I needed tonight

And I dont know
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

Im acting like a girl
With nothing to lose
When did I stop caring
About anything but you

And I dont know
Where I lost control
And couldnt take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I cant win so I give in
The more I fight it just gets stronger
Youre an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

Welcome distraction welcome distraction
Welcome distraction welcome distraction oh oh

Song Name: What Do You Say
What do you say when you just know
That hes the one and you wanna go fast
But hes taking it slow
And what do you do when hes next to you
But hes a little bit shy
Well heres something you can try

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

What do you see when you look in his eyes
Theres something there
That he cant disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel when you know its real
And you cant sit still
If you dont own up will yeah

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say

My imaginations running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

Hey hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together
Its a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everythings gonna go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday

What do you say
What do you say

What do you say
What do you say

Song Name: What To Wear
Shes looking in the mirror
The moments getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

School dance first chance
Always been a dreamer
Theres one guy shes shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it

Blue dress angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes purse hair tied back
And you should see her
Shes got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace love
One thing leads into another
Dream big aim small
Man you gotta love her
Shes got her hopes up
Got em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Shes standing in her bedroom
Hell be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
Shes got her diary to show
That shes been waiting for this all her life

First date cant wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
Hes looking right at her
She thinks about it

Sixteen blue jeans Abercrombie Tshirt
Shoes purse hair tied back
And you should see her
Shes got her magic
Floating through the air

Peace love
One thing leads into another
Dream big aim small
Man you gotta love her
Shes got her hopes up
Got em up to there
Wondering what to wear

The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again

Move out find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer

Peace love
One thing leads into another
Dream big aim small
Man you gotta love her
Shes got her hopes up
Got em up to there
Shes got her hopes up
Got em up to there
Wondering what to wear

Ohh oh oh
Wondering what to wear

Song Name: Who I've Always Been
You walk in here with your guitar man
Your shiny boots and your full on band
A smile on your face a knife in your hand
Singing songs youve got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

But dont worry yourself I aint your competition
But dont flatter yourself that was never my intention

I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you wanna be and who Ive always been

I walk in here with a beat up case
The same guitar Ive always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old a small town raised
You tell the crowd youre paying dues
I tell them This is what I do
And its what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume

And say life on musical road is rough conditions
Oh but the easy ride was never my ambition

I wanna talk about what you are that I aint
Lets talk about what you do that I cant
Lets talk about me and you in an empty room and who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about what you wanna be and who Ive always been

Lets talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen I was on this stage
So wheres that crown gotten you these days
When its me and you and the same damn games

So what have you got that I aint
And what can you do that I cant
Lets put me and you in an empty room and see who wins
Lets talk about what you did to get here
Lets talk about blood and sweat and tears
Lets talk about who you wanna be girl and who Ive always been

Song Name: Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)
He said Lets get out of this town
Drive out of the city away from the crowds
I thought Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha
Wildest dreams ah ha

I said No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
But this is gettin good now

Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha Ha ha
Wildest dreams ah ha

Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin Burnin it It down Down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow Follow you You around Around
Follow you around

Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just pretend
Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your Just pretend just pretend
Wildest dreams ah ha Ahah
In your wildest dreams ah ha
Even if its just in your
In your wildest dreams ah ha
In your wildest dreams ah ha

Song Name: Writing Songs About You
I cant believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Whyd you have to look so good
Dont you know Im trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it
But how can I put out this fire
When youre the one who lit it

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you

Ive got a stack of papers so high
And its all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I cant get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Until I do
Ill keep writing songs about you

And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldnt let you in

I cant wait for the day I stop pretending
That Im really OK cause Im not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Til I do

Ill just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That Im really OK when Im not
Wanna know how it feels to be over you for real
Til I do
Ill keep writing songs about you

Song Name: You Do
Here I am once again
In your driveway thinking I should be leaving
I should go but its so entertaining watching you breathing
You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head
So goodbye its not goodnight
Cause Ill be seeing you in my dreamin

Boy you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do

In a daze pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

Boy you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends tell them all about you
Always looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do

I run right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
Its only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

Cause you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin so bad I spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my all my friends tell them all about you
And its looking like a one of those nights
When youre thinkin about a kiss til the morning light
You got me you do
Oh you got me you do

Song Name: Your Anything
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if youll ever find
Just what you want
A hometown number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or thats what you thought
But heres what youve got

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything

If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either onell be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything

Its not like Im giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you its just so easy to do

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need

If thats what you need

I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
Ill be your angel giving up her wings
If thats what you need
Id give everything to be your anything

Song Name: Your Face
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
She sees his face
In every space
Every room

And I know if I turn around you wont be there
If I close my eyes will you be there

I dont wanna lose your face
And I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

Ive got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call

And now I wonder to myself
Who were you Where are you
Were you ever here at all

I dont wanna lose your face
And I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips
And I had you

I dont wanna lose your face
I dont wanna wake up one day
And not remember what time erased
And I dont wanna turn around
Cause Im not scared
Of what love gave me and took away
And I dont wanna lose your face

I dont wanna lose your face
I dont wanna turn around
